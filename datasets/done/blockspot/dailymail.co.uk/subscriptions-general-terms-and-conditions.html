A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens for everyone involved:</p>
 <p id="eFEpnVyOrzyKI">(i) The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;</p>
 <p id="efvS4CwF9VvX1">(ii) The arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and</p>
 <p id="e3zNTi0m1RIZa">(iii) Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
 <p id="ebCN-uuWMe5_P">(iv) Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition of any claim.</p>
 <p id="e0At2LQSZGtVp">10.1.2. You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us arising out of or relating to your use of the Services:</p>
 <p id="eNNs2_yk6ia4c">(i) <strong>TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
 <p id="eGEK9ETVuLB98">(ii) You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit involving any such dispute; and</p>
 <p id="e7nfpGj8U2gBA">(iii) You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose or it is forever barred.</p>
 <p id="eQONmCR6tfksw">10.1.3. If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.</p>
 <p id="eoRumtYUOK2-b">10.1.4. This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or us from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or us from (i) applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary, or (ii) seeking relief in any state or federal court for disputes related to a violation or possible violation of our intellectual property rights.</p>

 <p id="ewW_6tpD1N43i">11.1. Transferring rights: You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of any rights or obligations arising under or in connection with these Terms, without our prior written consent.

 <p id="eTN3cood-EmUN">11.2. Third party rights: These Terms are between you and us. Nobody else can enforce them and neither of us will need to ask anybody else to sign-off on ending or changing them.</p>
 <p id="eXizzDo60Kkjy">11.3. If the Terms are invalidated: If a court or other authority decides that some of these Terms are unlawful, the rest will continue to apply.</p>
 <p id="eklGr5-J63ai5">11.4. Delays: We might not immediately chase you for not doing something (like paying) or for doing something you're not allowed to, but that doesn’t mean we can't do it later.</p>

 <p data-gid="eqJawfXil9xi" id="e91yFaj8iugsE">9.3. You agree not to use the Subscription for commercial purposes without obtaining our prior written agreement; and shall not copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display, post or transmit in any form or by any means any content of the Subscription except as permitted above.</p>
 <h3 data-gid="eAROKsWM9G-p">10. Applicable Law and Disputes&nbsp;</h3>
 <p data-gid="eioQoFyANNdY" id="eUUI9RvAEm30D">These terms are governed by English law, and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Subscriptions in the English courts. If you live in Scotland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Subscriptions in either the Scottish or the English courts. If you live in Northern Ireland, you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Subscriptions in either the Northern Irish or the English courts.</p>
 <h3 data-gid="enlpRTCorHzm">11. Other important terms</h3>
 <p data-gid="eXa2OvRHB9j2" id="enqYY9eEC3zh3">11.1. Transferring rights: You may not transfer, assign, charge or otherwise dispose of any rights or obligations arising under or in connection with these Terms, without our prior written consent. You agree that we may transfer our rights and obligations under our contract with you to a third party purchaser of our business or to an affiliate, in which case we shall notify you and explain your options.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-gid="eL5i3YDWVOgP" id="eCnARQ5_Qqw2M">11.2. Third party rights: These Terms are between you and us. Nobody else can enforce them and neither of us will need to ask anybody else to sign-off on ending or changing them.</p>
 <p data-gid="emnw14r_YpQR" id="eR4KiK2IJ6J2V">11.3. If the Terms are invalidated: If a court or other authority decides that some of these Terms are unlawful, the rest will continue to apply.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-gid="e7BgtaCmfWzq" id="euqeVqchabJlh">11.4. Delays: We might not immediately chase you for not doing something (like paying) or for doing something you're not allowed to, but that doesn’t mean we can't do it later.</p>
