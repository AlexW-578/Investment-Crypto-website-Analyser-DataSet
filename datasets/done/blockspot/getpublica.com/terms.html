Customer shall pay Company all fees set forth in the Agreement (collectively, the â<strong>Fees</strong>â). All undisputed Fees are nonrefundable and are payable within thirty (30) days of receipt of the invoice. If Customer disputes the validity of an invoiced Fee, Customer must provide prompt written notice within thirty (30) days to Company stating the details of any such dispute, provided that Customer waives any right to bring any dispute related to an invoiced Fee if not raised within thirty (30) days. If only a portion of an invoice is in dispute, Customer shall pay all undisputed amounts in accordance with the terms of this Section 4. Acceptance by Company of any partial payment does not constitute a waiver of the disputed amounts. All invoices are payable in U.S. dollars, unless specified otherwise and approved. Company reserves the right to charge a late fee on any amount not paid after fifteen (15) days of receipt of written notification of non-payment equal to 1.5% per month (or, if lower, the maximum rate allowed by law) on the outstanding balance for the period such payment is delinquent. In the event Customer fails to make timely payment, Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneysâ fees) incurred by Company in collecting such amounts.Â </p><p>B. Customer shall be responsible for providing Company with (a) correct billing information which shall include the applicable IO/PO number and the name and address, and (b) any additional information that Customer reasonably requires to be reflected in an invoice issued by Company. Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall any delay in payment be excused due to, Customer&#x27;s failure to provide Company with any of the information described in the preceding sentence. Company may, in its sole discretion, invoice Customer through one of its subsidiaries or affiliates in the same country or region as Customer. Any invoice originating from a Company affiliate or subsidiary shall be considered a valid invoice and all payments shall be made to the bank account designated in such invoice.Â </p><p>C. Customer agrees to pay the Fees on any detected use of the Services as recorded by Companyâs technology. Companyâs reporting and usage statistics shall at all times be determinative for billing purposes. Fees are calculated according to numbers ofÂ </p><p>impressions, then (save as may otherwise be agreed by the parties) those impressions shall be counted and calculated by Company according to reasonable industry standards. Customer agrees that it shall be billed for all impressions processed and analyzed by Company.Â </p><p>D. Currency Conversion. Where Fees are stated in an Order in one currency, but are required to be paid or understood in another currency, then Company may convert such Fees into the latter currency using the rolling average exchange rate over the past four calendar quarters preceding that date, as provided at http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/. Additionally, where Fees are converted from USD or EUR into additional currencies in an Order, Company may, once per calendar year at its sole discretion, update theÂ </p><p>non-USD/EUR rates using the rolling average exchange rate over the past four calendar quarters preceding that date, as provided at http://www.oanda.com/currency/converter/. At Company&#x27;s discretion, Company may provide pricing in non-USD currencies within the Publisher UI solely for Customer&#x27;s reference and convenience. Company is not liable to Customer for any discrepancies or inaccuracies within any currency conversion function contained or displayed within the Publisher UI and Company is not responsible for Customer&#x27;s reliance on any such currency conversion provided by Company.Â </p><p>E.

If either party is required to collect sales taxes, value added taxes (âVATâ),</p><p>goods and services taxes (âGSTâ) or other applicable taxes related to any payments under this Agreement and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities, then such party shall duly collect such amounts and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities. If either party is required to deduct or withhold taxes from any payments made to the other party under this Agreement and remit such taxes to the appropriate taxing authorities, then such party shall duly withhold such amounts and remit such taxes and shall pay to the other party the remaining net amount after the taxes have been withheld. Both parties will cooperate with each other in providing the necessary tax documentation in order to effect payment.Â </p><p>F. Payment Terms for Publicaâs Managed Platform Connect and Platform Connect solution (collectively referred to herein as â<strong>PC</strong>â). Solely where Customer uses the PC solution the following terms apply:Â </p><p>(i) PC Seller. If Customer elects to utilize the PC as a seller (â<strong>PC Seller</strong>â), Company will collect the amounts owed from PC Buyers for inventory sales on PC Sellerâs behalf and will remit such amounts, after first deducting any Fees owed to Company. Company shall have no liability for and shall not be required to credit or pay PC Seller for, any sums related to the inventory sales not yet cleared from the buyer (â<strong>PC Buyer</strong>â) to Company. For clarity, in addition to any fees owed for the PC solution, Company will continue to charge PC Seller its applicable Fees for its Services. Inventory sold will be reported to the PC Seller on the first day of the following month and Company Fees will be included in invoices sent in its normal billing cycle. Subject to the foregoing, once Company receives the PC Sellerâs invoice, payment will be remitted within sixty (60) days.Â </p><p>(ii) PC Buyer. If Customer elects to use the PC as a PC Buyer, Company will charge PC Buyer its applicable Fees for its Services.

This processing of Personal Data shall be governed by the Data Protection Terms set out at integralads.com/data-protection, as may be updated by Company from time to time, which shall be incorporated into the Order and form an integral part of the Order. For purposes of clarity, except as provided in the Agreement, the Personal Data processed does not contain any names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses or other contact details or information.

Unless expressly agreed otherwise, an Order shall commence on the effective date noted therein and shall continue for one-year (the â<strong>Initial Term</strong>â). After the expiration of the Initial Term, the Order shall automatically renew for successive one-year periods (each a â<strong>Renewal Term</strong>â) unless either party gives not less than sixty (60) daysâ prior written notice of its intention not to renew. The Initial Term and any Renewal Term shall be referred to collectively as the â<strong>Term</strong>â.Â </p><p>C. The Agreement shall terminate thirty (30) days after a partyâs receipt of written notice that such party is in material breach of any terms or conditions, unless such party cures such breach within said thirty (30) day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event Company determines, based on its reasonable, good faith judgment, that such breach by Customer is not curable within such thirty (30) day period, Company may terminate the Agreement immediately upon notice to Customer of such incurable breach.Â </p><p>D. Company may immediately suspend Customer&#x27;s use of, or access to, the Services, without notice, (i) if it believes that there is a significant threat to the functionality, security, integrity, or availability of the Services, (ii) if it believes that Customer or Customer&#x27;s users are accessing or using the Services to commit an illegal act, (iii) if Customer fails to pay undisputed Fees under an issued invoice within the time period set forth in Section 3, or (iv) if Customer fail to complete Companyâs client onboarding questionnaire(s) (e.g., billing and compliance) to the full satisfaction of Company, within seven (7) days from the execution date of the applicable Order. When reasonably practicable and lawfully permitted, Company will provide Customer with advance notice of any such suspension. Company will use reasonable efforts to re-establish the Services promptly after it determines that the issue causing the suspension has been resolved.

If Customer fails to cease using and/or remove all Company Data in accordance with the preceding sentence, Customer may, at Companyâs option, continue to be charged at its then current Fees until such Company Data is removed. All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, intellectual property ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, data protection, indemnity and limitations of liability.Â </p><p>11. <strong>EXPORT CONTROLS, SANCTIONS, AND ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS.Â </strong></p><p>Customer shall not export, re-export, transfer, or use the Services in violation of (i) the Export Administration Regulations or any other applicable export controls, (ii) applicable economic sanctions laws, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Departmentâs Office of Foreign Assets Control (â<strong>OFAC</strong>â) (collectively, â<strong>Sanctions</strong>â), or (iii) the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or any other applicable laws related to the prevention of corruption or bribery.

Company shall have the right to immediately terminate Services should a breach of the foregoing terms occur.Â </p><p>12. <strong>FEEDBACK.Â </strong></p><p>If Customer or any of Customer&#x27;s employees or contractors sends or transmits any communications or materials to Company by mail, email, telephone, or otherwise, suggesting or recommending changes to the Services, including without limitation, new features or functionality relating thereto, or any comments, questions, suggestions, or the like (âFeedbackâ), Company is free to use such Feedback irrespective of any other obligation or limitation between the parties governing such Feedback. Customer hereby assign to Company on Customer&#x27;s behalf, and on behalf of Customer&#x27;s employees, contractors and/or agents, all right, title, and interest in, and Company is free to use, without any attribution or compensation to any party, any ideas,</p><p>know-how, concepts, techniques, or other intellectual property rights contained in the Feedback, for any purpose whatsoever, although Company is not required to use any Feedback.Â </p><p>13. <strong>PUBLICITY.Â </strong></p><p>A. Neither party shall (a) make any public statements or announcements, or statements to third parties, regarding the Services provided by Company under the Agreement, or (b) use the other partyâs trademarks or logos, in each case, without obtaining prior written approval from the other party in each instance; provided that without such approval, Company may list Customerâs name and use Customerâs logo in Companyâs list of customers.Â </p><p>B. At Companyâs request, Customer and Company will issue a joint press release to announce the collaboration under the applicable Order, with the content to be pre-approved in writing by each party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), within one (1) month of the effective date of the applicable Order (or such other date mutually agreed upon by the parties). A party will obtain consent from the other party prior to issuance of any future press releases.Â </p><p>C. At Companyâs request, each party will collaborate with the other party on joint customer case studies, webinars and speaking engagements in connection with the Services, with the content to be mutually agreed to by parties, which may be used in either partyâs marketing activities.Â </p><p>14. <strong>ASSIGNMENT.Â </strong></p><p>Neither party shall have the right to assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned, except that: (i) either party may assign its rights and obligations to a successor to substantially all its relevant assets or business or equity securities upon prior written notice to the other party; and (ii) Company may assign its rights and obligations to an affiliated entity that is owned or controlled by, or under common ownership or control with, Company upon prior written notice to Customer. Nothing in the foregoing prohibits Company from engaging subcontractors to perform services provided that Company shall remain liable to Customer for any such subcontractorâs services and work product. Any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null and void. No assignment or delegation shall relieve the assigning or delegating party of any of its obligations hereunder.Â </p><p>15. <strong>FORCE MAJEURE</strong>.Â </p><p>With the exception of a partyâs payment obligations hereunder, neither party shall be liable by reason of any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder for any cause beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to electrical outages, failure of internet service providers, default due to Internet disruption (including without limitation denial of service attacks), riots, insurrection, acts of terrorism, war (or similar), fires, flood, earthquakes, explosions, and other acts of God.Â </p><p>16. <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>.Â </p><p>The Agreement, including any attached exhibits which are hereby incorporated by reference into the Agreement, are the entire agreement between Customer and Company with respect to the Services, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Company with respect to the Services or any</p><p>other of the subject matter hereof. Unless permitted by these Standard Terms or the applicable Order, no amendment or modification of the Agreement shall be made except by a writing signed by both parties. If any provision of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. No failure of Company to enforce any of its rights under the Agreement will act as a waiver of such rights. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of the Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneysâ fees. Excluding any claims related to an invoiced Fee as set forth in Section 3 above, neither party may bring any action for a claim arising under this Order, whether under breach of contract, warranty, negligence, or strict liability, later than one (1) year after the cause of action arose or date that the affected party knew or should have known about the cause of action. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.
