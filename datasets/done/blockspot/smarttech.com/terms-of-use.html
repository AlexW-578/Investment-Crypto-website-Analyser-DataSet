For that purpose, SMART may, at its election, designate SMART employees and/or outside entities to act as moderators for the product.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;report\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Reporting a Concern, Dispute or Take-Down Request&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you believe someone is violating these Terms you may report such abuse to privacy@smarttech.com. Additionally, you may request SMART remove any Submission you have made and, upon confirmation that the Submission is yours, SMART will try to remove the Submission. If you believe another user is violating your copyright, you may send a take-down notice to SMART at privacy@smarttech.com including a) your contact details (name, telephone, email, address); b) identifying the Submission in question, and c) details on the basis of the infringement claim. SMART will make an assessment and if, in our sole opinion, such action is merited, we will remove the Submission in question. Other than this removal remedy, SMART shall have no further obligations or liability regarding copyright infringement disputes for submissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;revoke\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Revoking Your License&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you do not comply with these Terms we may revoke your license(s) and terminate this agreement. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;security\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your passwords, account information and access.

You agree to ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session and to &lt;a href=\&quot;/connect-with-smart\&quot;&gt;notify SMART&lt;/a&gt; immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;gallery\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;SMART Gallery&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Terms, you acknowledge that SMART supplied images, pictures, multimedia, SMART Notebook files or pages, backgrounds or themes forming all or part of the SMART Gallery are subject to the following additional conditions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;You are permitted to use an image that is in a .galleryitem or a .gallerycollection file format only with SMART products (such as SMART Table software, SMART Table Toolkit software, SMART Notebook software and SMART Notebook express software or web application). Use for any other purpose is not permitted. You may not use the image on third-party software, or include it in any product for sale or for a fee. You may not import directly into any third-party software any .galleryitem or .gallerycollection image. This restriction may not be circumvented by merely converting .galleryitem or .gallerycollection images into a .notebook file format.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Images may be incorporated into a .notebook file (meaning part of a lesson or more than just the .galleryitem or .gallerycollection image). The .notebook file may be exported into another file format and that other file format may be used on third-party software, provided it is not included in a product for sale or for a fee.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;You may access, copy, distribute, publish, and otherwise use unmodified images subject to the condition that you maintain a reference to the original author and/or the SMART logo or trademark to the extent that same was contained on the image, and further subject to the rest of these conditions.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;You are not permitted to modify, adapt, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter images or the SMART Lesson Activity toolkit template (including flash) code.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Images that are SMART Notebook files, backgrounds, pages, themes, interactive files, or multimedia may be modified, subject to the other terms of this agreement, including retaining and conspicuously reproducing source information and/or attribution to the original creator referred to in the image.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;You are not permitted to use the images in whole or in part for resale or any commercial purpose, whether or not incorporated into another product or offering, and whether the original SMART Gallery image or a derivative thereof.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;You are not permitted to download the images in mass or bulk amounts, regardless of whether the intent is to use such content for commercial purposes; and are not to be (whether in original form or modified) offered, distributed, transmitted, or displayed, on or in a site, product, offering or service, including those competitive to SMART&#39;s offerings or otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Certain images (such as the 3D or Mixed Reality images) may not be fully or properly viewable without the use of the SMART Mixed Reality software, which may only be available under a separate license and associated license fee.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;content\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;SMART Provided Content&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the information on our website and in our products is as accurate and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, the information does not represent a commitment on the part of SMART. SMART MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO ITS USE. Information published may contain references to products, programs or services that are not announced or available in all countries. Such references do not imply that SMART intends to make such products, programs or services available in any specific country. The information available is provided as a convenience only.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Images (such as SMART product images, for example) and all other content contained in our products that is not specifically offered for download by the users (such as through the SMART Exchange&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; website, for example) is the property of SMART or its licensees and you agree not to copy, publish, distribute, display or otherwise use such materials other than viewing them, without the express written permission of SMART.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;3rdparty\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Third Party Offerings and Sites&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our products, primarily because of user Submissions, may contain or reference links to third-party websites. Clicking on links contained in Submissions is done so at your own risk. The inclusion of any link or reference to a third-party service, product or promotion is not and does not necessarily imply an affiliation, sponsorship, endorsement, approval, investigation, verification or monitoring by SMART of any information contained in any third-party site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you decide to use third-party services, you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions governing any third-party services (including their privacy policies). You agree that the third-party, and not SMART, is responsible for the performance of the third-party services, your privacy, the information contained in such third-party site and for your use or inability to use such third-party site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Third-party content is the sole responsibility of the person originating that content. You agree that we do not control and are not responsible in any way for third-party content.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;a id=\&quot;submission\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;User Provided Content (Submissions)&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In these Terms, the expression \&quot;Submission\&quot; means content submitted by users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You acknowledge that all submissions, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, accessible through our products are the sole responsibility of the person from whom the Submission originated, and YOU ARE USING SUCH SUBMISSION AND ALL MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN AT YOUR OWN RISK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You retain all ownership rights in your Submissions and SMART will never sell your Submissions or personal information. However, we need to be able to reproduce your Submissions as part of the service (i.e., others can read them).  As such, by submitting any Submissions you are granting SMART, for the sole purpose of providing the applicable service, a royalty free, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to use, reproduce, merge, distribute, transmit, display, perform, translate and reformat your submissions (in whole or in part) in any manner required to operate the applicable service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SMART does not control the Submissions provided by users, and can therefore not guarantee the accuracy, quality, integrity or ownership of such Submission. You acknowledge that you may be exposed to Submission material that you find offensive or indecent, or for which the underlying rights have not been properly obtained. You acknowledge that SMART assumes no responsibility for Submissions posted by third parties which is available through our products. You are solely responsible for your use of the Submissions and any disputes you may have with other users, even though SMART may provide a method for users to advise of a dispute or complaint (please see the Reporting a Concern, Dispute or Take-Down Request section for additional information).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SMART reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to review any Submissions and to remove or refuse to remove or post any submissions or links within Submissions in its sole discretion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While in certain portions of some products, you are able to remove Submissions made by you or restrict access to them, you acknowledge that this license cannot be terminated, or the waiver revoked by you once the Submission is made. For example, if other users have downloaded your Submission for creation of a lesson, they continue to have the right to use such Submission that was downloaded in accordance with these Terms even after you remove your Submission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You shall not contribute or edit any Submission, unless you have the legal right to submit your Submissions, which includes, without limitation, that you are the author or licensee of any copyrighted content that you provide, and that you are legally permitted to contribute it in accordance with a license.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A PARTY AGGRIEVED BY YOUR UPLOADING OF ANY CONTENT WHICH IS, INTER ALIA, A BREACH OF COPYRIGHT OR DEFAMATORY MAY TAKE LEGAL ACTION WHICH COULD RESULT IN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING DISCLOSED AND YOU HAVING TO PAY COMPENSATION TO THE AGGRIEVED PARTY.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; id=\&quot;youtube\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;YouTube API Services&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our support pages (e.g., &lt;a rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href=\&quot;https://support.smarttech.com/docs/software/notebook/current/en/training-and-videos/default.cshtml\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Notebook&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; training&lt;/a&gt;) incorporate YouTube&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href=\&quot;https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#definition-api-client\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;API Client&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that use &lt;a rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href=\&quot;https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#definition-youtube-api-services\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;YouTube API Services&lt;/a&gt; so, by using our support site you are agreeing to be bound by YouTube&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href=\&quot;https://www.youtube.com/static?gl=CA&amp;amp;template=terms\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a rel=\&quot;noopener noreferrer\&quot; href=\&quot;https://policies.google.com/privacy\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Google Privacy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;#terms\&quot;&gt;Back to general terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr class=\&quot;hr-legal\&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Term and Termination&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This agreement starts when you begin using our product and automatically renews until terminated by either party.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You may at any time terminate this agreement by sending a termination request to SMART at privacy@smarttech.com.

<h2>SMART Meeting Pro<sup>&reg;</sup></h2>
<p>Please ensure you read the Introduction as it contains important information regarding this binding legal agreement between you and SMART.</p>
<p>Subject to payment of applicable license fees SMART grants and you accept a non-exclusive, non-transferable (subject to subsection (c) below), non-sublicensable license to use Meeting Pro subject to the following limitations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Meeting Pro is licensed per Room, where "Room" means a meeting space in a single physical location containing one computer and at least one, but not more than 16, Display Devices (defined below) where all such Display Devices are connected to the same single computer.</li>
    <li>
    Unless you have written permission from SMART, you can only connect your computer running Meeting Pro to the following "Display Devices":

        <li>SMART Board<sup>&reg;</sup> interactive whiteboard</li>
        <li>SMART Board<sup>&reg;</sup> integrated flat panels</li>

        <li>such other SMART product introduced by SMART from time-to-time for use with this Software.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For each software license acquired you may use such software on a single computer owned and controlled by you. Provided that you do not exceed the number of licenses acquired, you may deactivate and reactivate the software four (4) times on different computers (all owned and controlled by you) to address equipment replacement or changes in staffing.</li>
    <li>You acknowledge that in order to enable the collaboration capabilities of the software functionality you will be required to separately purchase either: i) a server and/or user licenses of Bridgit<sup>&reg;</sup> conferencing software, or ii) other third-party server products, all of which will be subject to the applicable SMART or third-party (respectively) end user license agreements.

</ol>
<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Maintenance.</p>
<p>"Maintenance" for Meeting Pro means access to commercially released updates and upgrades (meaning new versions and point releases of the software which contain enhancements improving the functionality or capabilities of the software) for the specific license of software associated with or offered together with the Maintenance program, in all cases limited to that which SMART makes generally available to its subscribed Maintenance customers. Under the Maintenance program you will receive commercially released updates and upgrades: new versions of the software that include components, performance, features and feature sets that are new to the software and a change from your previously purchased version (e.g. from version 2.2 to version 3.0); and you will receive future activation support to activate the updated or upgraded software from your previously purchased version.</p>
<p>Maintenance specifically excludes services in connection with computer viruses or conflicts involving software that is not installed or introduced by SMART. Maintenance further excludes add-ons, plug-ins, customizations, new applications, modules or other software that is not generally and regularly made available to users of the software for no additional fee, but rather is separately made available by SMART.</p>
<p>The Maintenance period is calculated commencing one (1) year from the date of purchase of the software license offering associated with the Maintenance program, and continues for the duration of the term based on the length of the Maintenance program purchased by you (the "Maintenance period"). You may elect to purchase a longer Maintenance program, as may be made available by SMART, for each license of the software. Ongoing Maintenance beyond the initial or subsequent Maintenance period(s) may be separately purchased and shall be subject to the terms of any applicable additional Maintenance program agreement provided by SMART at such time (if any). In the event an extension to the Maintenance period is not obtained prior to the expiry of the Maintenance period then in effect, you must bring Maintenance fees in arrears up to date to qualify for ongoing Maintenance or may purchase an upgrade for the applicable software license (with the associated required Maintenance fee, if applicable).</p>
<p>SMART reserves the right to terminate or modify available Maintenance programs at any time in its sole discretion; provided, that any such modifications will not affect any Maintenance programs already ordered and accepted by SMART prior to such modifications during the applicable Maintenance period, except as mutually agreed by both parties.</p>

<h2>SMART Software Admin Portal (SSP)</h2>
<p>The SMART Software Admin Portal allows you to manage your account information including product keys, activations and the end dates of your current software entitlements. </p>

As such, do not give your SSP login credentials or admin access to anyone you don&rsquo;t want to have access to this information and who is not bound by your own organization&rsquo;s privacy policy. </p>

Notwithstanding this, you agree that SMART shall still be entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
<p>This agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.</p>

<h2>Invalidity of Provisions</h2>
<p>If any provision of the Terms is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that portion will be construed consistent with applicable law as nearly as possible, or failing that, deemed omitted, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. The failure by a party to exercise any right shall not operate as a waiver of such party's right to exercise such right or any other right in the future.</p>
<p>Any waiver or modification of these Terms by SMART must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of SMART and they must expressly reference the applicable provisions of the Terms.</p>

<h2>Moderators</h2>
<p>SMART has no obligation to monitor Submissions (defined in the User Provided Content section) or other materials. However, moderators (yours, ours or both) may monitor Submissions. Moderators are not obligated to pre-screen Submissions, monitor on a "real time" basis, or edit Submissions. As a user, you may see content that is offensive or objectionable and it is your responsibility to report it.</p>
<p>SMART reserves the right to manage the Submissions in order to facilitate the orderly distribution of information through the product. For that purpose, SMART may, at its election, designate SMART employees and/or outside entities to act as moderators for the product.</p>

<h2>Reporting a Concern, Dispute or Take-Down Request</h2>
<p>If you believe someone is violating these Terms you may report such abuse to privacy@smarttech.com. Additionally, you may request SMART remove any Submission you have made and, upon confirmation that the Submission is yours, SMART will try to remove the Submission. If you believe another user is violating your copyright, you may send a take-down notice to SMART at privacy@smarttech.com including a) your contact details (name, telephone, email, address); b) identifying the Submission in question, and c) details on the basis of the infringement claim. SMART will make an assessment and if, in our sole opinion, such action is merited, we will remove the Submission in question. Other than this removal remedy, SMART shall have no further obligations or liability regarding copyright infringement disputes for submissions.</p>

<h2>SMART Gallery</h2>
<p>In addition to the Terms, you acknowledge that SMART supplied images, pictures, multimedia, SMART Notebook files or pages, backgrounds or themes forming all or part of the SMART Gallery are subject to the following additional conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You are permitted to use an image that is in a .galleryitem or a .gallerycollection file format only with SMART products (such as SMART Table software, SMART Table Toolkit software, SMART Notebook software and SMART Notebook express software or web application). Use for any other purpose is not permitted. You may not use the image on third-party software, or include it in any product for sale or for a fee. You may not import directly into any third-party software any .galleryitem or .gallerycollection image. This restriction may not be circumvented by merely converting .galleryitem or .gallerycollection images into a .notebook file format.</li>
    <li>Images may be incorporated into a .notebook file (meaning part of a lesson or more than just the .galleryitem or .gallerycollection image). The .notebook file may be exported into another file format and that other file format may be used on third-party software, provided it is not included in a product for sale or for a fee.</li>
    <li>You may access, copy, distribute, publish, and otherwise use unmodified images subject to the condition that you maintain a reference to the original author and/or the SMART logo or trademark to the extent that same was contained on the image, and further subject to the rest of these conditions.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to modify, adapt, reverse engineer, or otherwise alter images or the SMART Lesson Activity toolkit template (including flash) code.</li>
    <li>Images that are SMART Notebook files, backgrounds, pages, themes, interactive files, or multimedia may be modified, subject to the other terms of this agreement, including retaining and conspicuously reproducing source information and/or attribution to the original creator referred to in the image.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to use the images in whole or in part for resale or any commercial purpose, whether or not incorporated into another product or offering, and whether the original SMART Gallery image or a derivative thereof.</li>
    <li>You are not permitted to download the images in mass or bulk amounts, regardless of whether the intent is to use such content for commercial purposes; and are not to be (whether in original form or modified) offered, distributed, transmitted, or displayed, on or in a site, product, offering or service, including those competitive to SMART's offerings or otherwise.</li>
    <li>Certain images (such as the 3D or Mixed Reality images) may not be fully or properly viewable without the use of the SMART Mixed Reality software, which may only be available under a separate license and associated license fee.</li>

<h2>SMART Provided Content</h2>
<p>While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the information on our website and in our products is as accurate and up-to-date as necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, the information does not represent a commitment on the part of SMART. SMART MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO ITS USE. Information published may contain references to products, programs or services that are not announced or available in all countries. Such references do not imply that SMART intends to make such products, programs or services available in any specific country. The information available is provided as a convenience only.</p>
<p>Images (such as SMART product images, for example) and all other content contained in our products that is not specifically offered for download by the users (such as through the SMART Exchange<sup>&reg;</sup> website, for example) is the property of SMART or its licensees and you agree not to copy, publish, distribute, display or otherwise use such materials other than viewing them, without the express written permission of SMART.</p>

<h2>Third Party Offerings and Sites</h2>
<p>Our products, primarily because of user Submissions, may contain or reference links to third-party websites. Clicking on links contained in Submissions is done so at your own risk. The inclusion of any link or reference to a third-party service, product or promotion is not and does not necessarily imply an affiliation, sponsorship, endorsement, approval, investigation, verification or monitoring by SMART of any information contained in any third-party site.</p>
<p>If you decide to use third-party services, you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions governing any third-party services (including their privacy policies). You agree that the third-party, and not SMART, is responsible for the performance of the third-party services, your privacy, the information contained in such third-party site and for your use or inability to use such third-party site.</p>
<p>Third-party content is the sole responsibility of the person originating that content. You agree that we do not control and are not responsible in any way for third-party content.</p>

<h2>User Provided Content (Submissions)</h2>
<p>In these Terms, the expression "Submission" means content submitted by users.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that all submissions, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, accessible through our products are the sole responsibility of the person from whom the Submission originated, and YOU ARE USING SUCH SUBMISSION AND ALL MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
<p>You retain all ownership rights in your Submissions and SMART will never sell your Submissions or personal information. However, we need to be able to reproduce your Submissions as part of the service (i.e., others can read them).  As such, by submitting any Submissions you are granting SMART, for the sole purpose of providing the applicable service, a royalty free, worldwide, non-exclusive, license to use, reproduce, merge, distribute, transmit, display, perform, translate and reformat your submissions (in whole or in part) in any manner required to operate the applicable service.</p>
<p>SMART does not control the Submissions provided by users, and can therefore not guarantee the accuracy, quality, integrity or ownership of such Submission. You acknowledge that you may be exposed to Submission material that you find offensive or indecent, or for which the underlying rights have not been properly obtained. You acknowledge that SMART assumes no responsibility for Submissions posted by third parties which is available through our products. You are solely responsible for your use of the Submissions and any disputes you may have with other users, even though SMART may provide a method for users to advise of a dispute or complaint (please see the Reporting a Concern, Dispute or Take-Down Request section for additional information).</p>
<p>SMART reserves the right, but is under no obligation, to review any Submissions and to remove or refuse to remove or post any submissions or links within Submissions in its sole discretion.</p>
<p>While in certain portions of some products, you are able to remove Submissions made by you or restrict access to them, you acknowledge that this license cannot be terminated, or the waiver revoked by you once the Submission is made. For example, if other users have downloaded your Submission for creation of a lesson, they continue to have the right to use such Submission that was downloaded in accordance with these Terms even after you remove your Submission.</p>
<p>You shall not contribute or edit any Submission, unless you have the legal right to submit your Submissions, which includes, without limitation, that you are the author or licensee of any copyrighted content that you provide, and that you are legally permitted to contribute it in accordance with a license.</p>
<p>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT A PARTY AGGRIEVED BY YOUR UPLOADING OF ANY CONTENT WHICH IS, INTER ALIA, A BREACH OF COPYRIGHT OR DEFAMATORY MAY TAKE LEGAL ACTION WHICH COULD RESULT IN YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BEING DISCLOSED AND YOU HAVING TO PAY COMPENSATION TO THE AGGRIEVED PARTY.</p>
