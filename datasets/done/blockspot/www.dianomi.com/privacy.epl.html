You will continue to receive recommendations that are selected based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e. contextually based ads). By opting out you give us permission to clear all the personalisation cookies that we previously stored regarding your account and to set a new cookie that tells us that we should no longer track you. If you clear all cookies from your browser after you opt out, you will also be clearing the cookie that tells us that you have opted out, so you will need to re-enrol in our opt-out.</span></p>

                            <p><span>Note that opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA consumer choice pages will not prevent you from seeing those companies’ advertisements. The opt out will prevent these companies from using your Information to display targeted or personalised ads or content to you. You may still receive ads that are served based on the content of website that you are viewing, for example, ads based on the context of the website rather than on your personal information.</span></p>
                            <p><span>If your browsers are configured to reject cookies by default when you visit the DAA consumer choice page, your opt out may not be effective because your browser will not accept the opt-out cookies.

<strong>Additional Information for California Residents</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
If you are a resident of California, please review these additional privacy disclosures.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
California law requires us to disclose the categories of personal information we collect and how we use them, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, and the third parties with whom we share personal information, which we have explained in this Privacy Policy. You also have the right to request what information we collect and how we use and disclose it. Additionally, you have the right to access and delete your personal information. Please note that we must take steps to verify your identity before we can fulfill any consumer request. If we are not able to verify you by matching two data points, we may need to ask you for further information about you for verification purposes (e.g. browser and/or device ID) so that we can fulfill your request. 
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
In addition, we are required to provide you with certain information about the business and commercial purposes for which we collect and share your personal information. We use and disclose the information we collect for the business purposes described in the <a href="#personal-data-use">how we use your personal data</a> section of this policy, including: to allow our clients to select and display advertisements, to understand how users interact with our services, for auditing purposes, to detect security incidents, to prevent fraud, debug, and repair errors, and for other purposes described above.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
Dianomi does not use cookies for the purpose of behavioral targeting in California. Dianomi will serve ads to Californian users contextually and therefore will not require users’ consent for targeting purposes. Dianomi does not sell User Information and does not participate in the “sale” of data in California in relation to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100-§ 1798.198).
