    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the legal basis for collecting and processing Customer Information</strong></h3>
    
    
    
    <p>The legal basis for collecting and processing any Personal Data contained in Customer’s Information will depend on the specific Personal Data as well as the purpose for which they were collected and processed.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>We shall collect and process your Personal Data solely under the following legal bases (i) in order to negotiate, execute and perform our contract with you (art. 6 § 1b Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (ii) where you have given us your explicit and free consent to collect and process your data in relation to a specific purpose (art. 6 § 1a Regulation (EU) 2016/679), (iii) when the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (art. 6 § 1f Regulation (EU) 2016/679)&nbsp;(iv) when we have a legal obligation to collect or process Personal Data in accordance with applicable legislation (art. 6 § 1c Regulation (EU) 2016/679).</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we store information and for how long</strong></h3>
    
    
    
    <p>The information you directly provide to us is stored in our secure databases. We take the appropriate technical and operational measures to ensure that any personal information disclosed to us is kept secure and protected.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The data storage time is decided based on the following specific criteria, as appropriate on each case:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>When the processing is based on a contractual relationship, your personal data are stored for as long as is necessary to perform the contract and for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims in accordance with said contract. Such retention period may not extend to longer than five (5) years after the termination or expiration of the contract. The above provision shall not be applicable to the retention of data, which is required for our compliance with legal obligations under the applicable legal framework, whereupon your personal data will be stored for as long as required by the relevant provisions or in case of continued court proceedings in which your data are required, whereupon your personal data will be stored for the duration of any court proceedings.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>When the processing is necessary for compliance with legal obligations under the applicable legal framework, your personal data will be stored for as long as required by the relevant provisions. The statute of limitations in accordance with the applicable legislation is 5 years.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we secure the information</strong></h3>
    
    
    
    <p>The company takes the appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with the legislation for the protection of personal data of its Customers.

    <p>In connection with collected personal data, the GDPR awards to Data Subjects the following rights, which you can exercise, as applicable, by contacting us.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong>&nbsp;You may withdraw your consent of processing your personal data at any time.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of correction/editing:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to correct your personal data.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of limitation:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data if:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>You question the accuracy of your personal data for the time it will take to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li>
    
    
    
    <li>Processing is illegal and you request the restriction of processing instead of the deletion of your personal data;</li>
    
    
    
    <li>We no longer need your personal data, but you need it to support, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of access:</strong>&nbsp;You may request from us information about the personal data of yours that we retain, including information about the categories of such personal data, the purpose of their use, where it was collected from, to whom they have been made known. You can obtain from us free of charge a copy of the personal data we keep for you. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for any further copy you may request.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of data portability:</strong>&nbsp;At your request, we will transfer your data to another controller, where technically feasible, provided that the processing is based on your consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract. Instead of receiving a copy of your personal data, you may ask us to transfer the data to another controller.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right to delete:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to delete your personal data if:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>they are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or processed,</li>
    
    
    
    <li>you wish to exercise your right to object to any further processing of your personal data,</li>
    
    
    
    <li>you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal basis for processing,</li>

    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    
    
    
    <p>The purpose of this section of the Privacy Policy is to provide transparency around what information we collect, how and why we collect it, how we use, store and secure it and with whom we share it, when End Users (referred to as “you” in this policy) visit our Customers’ websites and digital properties and interact with our Services.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
    
    
    
    <p>“<strong>Customers</strong>” means a media owner or other content provider that has a contractual relationship with Ads Interactive.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>“<strong>Customer Properties</strong>” means owned, exploited or licensed websites or other digital properties of media owners on which Ads Interactive’s Services are served and via which Personal Data may be collected.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>“<strong>Data Protection Legislation</strong>” means all applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the laws and regulations of the EU applicable to the Processing of Personal Data, such as: (i) the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“GDPR”); (ii) the EU e-Privacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC); and (iii) any national data protection laws made under or pursuant to (i) or (ii).</p>
    
    
    
    <p>“<strong>End User</strong>” or “<strong>User</strong>” means the visitors of our Customers’ Properties who interact with our Services.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>“<strong>Third-Party Vendors</strong>” or “<strong>Vendors</strong>” means Ads Interactive’s partners, including but not limited to advertisers, demand side platforms, ad exchanges, reporting platforms, agencies, agency trading desks, ad networks and any third party acting on behalf of media buyers.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The terms “<strong>Data Controller”, “Data Processor”, “Data Subject”, “Personal Data”, “Processing”, “Sub-processor”, “Third Country”</strong>&nbsp;and in general all terms contained in art. 4 of the GDPR have the meaning therein awarded to them.</p>
    
    
    
    <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>User Information</strong></h2>
    
    
    
    <p>Ads Interactive does not collect or process any User Information that can be used to directly identify an individual, such as name, address, phone number, email address or government identifiers, unless such data are voluntarily provided in relation to an inquiry or a service a User has requested. Such information may include User’s contact details and the content of its inquiries when the request is submitted.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>For delivering our services we rely on the usage of Third-Party Vendors who collect, through cookies, tags and other similar technologies, certain information about you and your device, each time you visit our Customer’s Properties (the “User Information”). The term “Cookie” is used in this Policy in the broad sense to include all similar techniques and technology. You can find more information on the definition of cookies and how we use them on our&nbsp;Cookie Registry.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>User information collected and processed in the context of our Services may include the following information:</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Information about your device and operating system, IP address and other online identifiers, the web pages accessed by you within our Customer’s Properties, the link that led you to a Customer’s website, the dates and times a User accesses a Customer’s website, event information (e.g., system crashes), general location information (e.g., city and state), hashed email addresses (when made available by the User). Depending on the provided Services, in-app User behaviors (e.g. online status, browsing activity, and clicks) and implicit non-precise device location inferred from search queries (when enabled by the User) may be collected.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>To learn more about the specific data collected through each of our Third-Party Vendors please check their respective privacy policies on the “Third-Party Vendors” section. You can view which of our Vendors are active on a Customer’s Property by viewing their respective Cookie and Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How we use User Information</strong></h3>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>The information collected each time you visit Customer’s Properties is primarily used in order to sell our Customer’s advertising space to advertisers with the assistance of our Third-Party Vendors. Furthermore, User Information is used in order to deliver advertising targeted on your inferred interests based on your activities across Customer’s Properties.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>We may also use the information collected in order to analyze and report on how you interact with an ad (e.g., tracking of views and click through rates) and the performance of that ad.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>To protect, investigate and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized or illegal activity.</li>
    
    
    
    <li>To improve our services and ensure their proper function.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the legal basis for Processing User Information</strong></h3>
    
    
    
    <p>Ads Interactive in its capacity as a Data Controller, insofar as it places cookies and retrieves information that is Personal Data and insofar as it determines the purposes and means of processing of End Users Personal Data to make decisions on the End Users Personal Data, shall process any Personal Data solely subject to a proper legal basis under the conditions established by the applicable Data Protection Legislation.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>The legal basis for collecting and processing User Information will depend on the specific Personal Data as well as the purpose for which they were collected and processed. Generally, any processing of your Personal Data in relation to our Services shall be based on your explicit and free consent to collect and process your data in relation to a specific purpose (e.g when you accept marketing cookies on a Customer’s Property) (art. 6 § 1a Regulation (EU) 2016/679). In rare cases we may collect and process your data (i) when the processing is in our or a third party’s legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms (e.g fraud detection) (art. 6 § 1f Regulation (EU) 2016/679) or (ii) when we have a legal obligation to collect or process Personal Data in accordance with applicable legislation (art. 6 § 1c Regulation (EU) 2016/679).</p>
    
		
<p>Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF 2.2) Compliance</p>

<p>Ads Interactive is fully compliant with the IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (TCF) version 2.2. Our platform ensures that all ad request parameters pass user consent verification in accordance with GDPR regulations.</p>

<p>As part of the TCF 2.2 framework, we handle user consent and process bid requests based on the following principles:</p>

<p>Consent Validation &amp; Data Processing Under TCF 2.2</p>



<p> <b>1. GDPR Compliance</b> - Flag (gdpr Parameter)</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A static parameter indicating whether GDPR applies to the ad request.</li>

<li>If set to 1, the system validates user consent using the gdpr_consent string.</li>

<li>If missing, the system determines GDPR applicability based on the user’s IP address lookup.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Consent String</b> (gdpr_consent Parameter)</p>


<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A Base64-encoded TCF string containing user consent preferences.</li>


<li>If present, the system verifies that the consent is valid and matches the vendor’s registered purposes.</li>


<li>If missing or invalid, personal data is automatically anonymized before sending requests to demand-side partners (DSPs).</li>
</ul>


<p><b>Data Anonymization</b>  in Case of Missing Consent</p>


<p>If a user does not provide valid consent, or if the consent string is missing, the following data is automatically anonymized or removed from the bid request:</p>


<p>Anonymized data</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>device.ip → The system masks the last octet of the IP address (e.g., 46.211.248.31 → 46.211.248.0).</li>



<li>device.geo &amp; user.geo → Only country, region, and city are retained, while more precise location data is removed.</li>
</ul>



<p>Removed data fields</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>user.id (User ID)</li>



<li>device.ifa<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; (Identifier for Advertisers)</li>



<li>device.ipv6</li>



<li>device.didsha1, device.didmd5, device.dpidsha1, device.dpidmd5, device.macsha1, device.macmd5</li>



<li>user.yob (Year of Birth)</li>



<li>user.gender</li>



<li>user.keywords, user.data</li>
</ul>



<p>This ensures that Ads Interactive does not process personal data without explicit user consent, in compliance with GDPR requirements.</p>



<p><b>Consent Verification &amp; Vendor List Validation</b></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The Ads Interactive system checks vendor registration every hour against the IAB Global Vendor List (GVL) at&nbsp;<a href="https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://iabeurope.eu/vendor-list-tcf</a>.</li>



<li>Only registered vendors in the GVL with the appropriate TCF 2.2 permissions are authorized to process user data.</li>



<li>If a vendor loses its authorization, the system automatically anonymizes user data in all ad requests associated with that vendor.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>Handling of Direct and Reseller Inventory</b></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Direct inventory: Publishers must enable GDPR compliance by switching on the GDPR toggle when creating/editing an inventory.</li>



<li>Reseller traffic: If an ad request originates from a regulated country and lacks a valid TCF 2.2 consent string, user data is automatically anonymized before being passed to downstream DSPs.</li>
</ul>



<p><b>FAQs – Common Consent Scenarios</b></p>



<p>What happens if the publisher provides a valid TCF 2.2 string?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The consent string is validated, and data is processed only according to user consent preferences.</li>
</ul>



<p>What happens if the system is not listed as an authorized vendor?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The request is forwarded without user data, ensuring compliance.</li>
</ul>



<p>What happens if the user explicitly denies consent for data processing?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The consent string remains encoded, but all personal data fields are set to anonymized values before being passed to demand partners.</li>
</ul>



<p>This structured approach ensures full GDPR and TCF 2.2 compliance, while maximizing transparency and user control over data processing.</p>

    <p><strong>Right of correction/editing:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to correct your personal data.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of limitation:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data if:</p>
    
    
    
    <ul>
    <li>You question the accuracy of your personal data for the time it will take to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li>
    
    
    
    <li>Processing is illegal and you request the restriction of processing instead of the deletion of your personal data;</li>
    
    
    
    <li>We no longer need your personal data, but you need it to support, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of access:</strong>&nbsp;You may request from us information about the personal data of yours that we retain, including information about the categories of such personal data, the purpose of their use, where it was collected from, to whom they have been made known. You can obtain from us free of charge a copy of the personal data we keep for you. We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee for any further copy you may request.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right of data portability:</strong>&nbsp;At your request, we will transfer your data to another controller, where technically feasible, provided that the processing is based on your consent or is necessary for the performance of a contract. Instead of receiving a copy of your personal data, you may ask us to transfer the data to another controller.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right to delete:</strong>&nbsp;You may ask us to delete your personal data if:</p>

    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right to object:</strong>&nbsp;You may object – at any time – to the processing of your personal data due to your particular situation, provided that the processing is not based on your consent but on our legitimate interest or on legitimate interests of third parties. In such case, we shall no more process your personal data unless we can prove that such use is justified by a legal reason and a legal right of ours superseding your right to object. If you object to us processing your data you are kindly requested to clarify whether you wish that such data is deleted or limited.</p>
    
    
    
    <p><strong>Right to lodge a complaint:</strong>&nbsp;In the event of an alleged breach of applicable privacy law, you may lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority.
