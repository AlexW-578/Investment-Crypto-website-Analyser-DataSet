            and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&ldquo;Demand&rdquo;). If
            you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you
            or us may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. Arbitration forms can be

            established by the JAMS Rules. If your claim exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by
            the JAMS Rules. In the event that the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of submitted
            documents, the arbitrator&rsquo;s decision and award will be made and delivered within six (6) months of the
            selection of the arbitrator, unless extended by the arbitrator. Except as expressly set forth herein, the
