<h4>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONSENT</h4>



<p>Consent of the User is required for Processing of Personal Information.

Such Consent will be valid only for the length of time needed to achieve the purposes for which it was requested. In all cases, Consent shall not be obtained through deception.</p>

<p>The form of the Consent sought by us may vary, depending upon the circumstances and the type of Personal Information collected. In determining the form of Consent, we will take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information.

<p>You can give your Consent in many ways, such as:</p>



<ul><li>an online form may be used to seek Consent. By completing and sending the form, you are giving Consent to Processing of your Personal Information;</li><li>a checkbox may be used to allow you to expressly agree that your Personal Information may be given to third parties;</li><li>Consent may be given orally when Personal Information is collected over the telephone; or</li><li>Consent may be given at the time that you use our Website.</li></ul>

Furthermore, such withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of Processing based on a Consent given prior to its withdrawal.</p>



<h4>6.          DISCLOSURE OF DANGEROUS BEHAVIOUR</h4>



<p>You acknowledge that some of your behaviours, speech, or written communication(s) may put us in a position where we are forced to divulge some of your Personal Information or other confidential information to a third party without your Consent. We may decide to communicate all or part of your Personal Information or other confidential information in order to prevent an act of violence, including a suicide, in such cases where we have a reasonable cause to believe that there is a serious risk of death or a Serious Bodily Injury threatening a person, or an identifiable group of persons, and where the nature of the threat generates a sense of urgency. For the purposes hereof, “<strong>Serious Bodily Injury</strong>” means any physical or psychological injury that is significantly detrimental to the physical integrity or the health or well-being of a person or an identifiable group of persons.</p>

<p>Each time we communicate Personal Information or other confidential information to a third party without your Consent in accordance with this Section 6, We shall note in your file (and establish such file if none exists), for each communication, the date and time of the communication, the identity of the person exposed to the danger, the identity of the person to whom the communication was made, the Serious Bodily Injury it was intended to prevent, the danger identified and its imminence, and finally, the information which was disclosed.</p>

Notwithstanding the foregoing:</p>



<ul><li>we will retain and use your Personal Information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies;</li><li>we may also retain logs of automatically collected information and usage dates for internal analytics and security purposes;</li><li>if we receive legal process pertaining to your account or your use of Website, we will retain your Personal Information for as long as we, in good faith, believe is necessary to comply with the legal process. Similarly, if we believe that you have been involved in any wrongdoing, we may preserve your data to defend or assert our rights.</li></ul>



<h4>8.          SAFEGUARDS</h4>

<p>Where the Breach of Security Measures is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we shall communicate to you without undue delay any such breach. Our communication will describe the nature of the Breach of Security Measures and shall contain at least the following information:</p>



<ol type="i"><li>nature of the Breach of Security Measures;</li><li>the name and contact details of our privacy officer or other contact person who can provide more information;</li><li>likely consequences of the Breach of Security Measures;</li><li>measures taken or proposed to be taken by us to address the Breach of Security Measures, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.</li></ol>

<p>You have the right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information in our custody and control, in accordance with the applicable law by emailing or writing to us at the contact information set out in Section 13. Where appropriate, the amended information shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.</p>
