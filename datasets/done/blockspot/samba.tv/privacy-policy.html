What Information We Receive</h3><ul role="list"><li><strong>Content Viewing Information:</strong> We receive information about the content you view and interact with when you enable our Services in your Smart TV (âContent Viewing Informationâ).

For example, when you elect to pair a broadcasterâs app to your TV, that broadcaster can use our technology to synchronize your experience on their mobile apps as you watch a show on your TV. Also, third-party apps and websites can use our measurement and advertising services to better understand usage of their services and enable the delivery of interest-based advertisements. The information we collect includes information about your use of those websites and apps, as well as information those apps or websites enable us to collect from their services. For example, a streaming video provider may enable us to receive information about the content you watch so that our recommendation service can suggest additional content that you might like.</li></ul><h3><strong>1.3 Information We Collect from Other Sources</strong></h3><p>Where the law permits, we may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.

The types of personal information we may share include device IDs, advertising IDs, IP addresses, hashed/encrypted versions of your email address or other identifier, or pseudonymous IDs.</p><div class="w-embed"><h5><a id="4"></a></h5></div><p>â</p><p>â</p><h2>4. Retention of Information</h2><p>We will generally retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. However, we may retain certain information as required by applicable law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no basis to continue processing your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it in accordance with applicable laws (though we may need to retain cached or archived copies for a certain period until deletion is possible).</p><p>We may store Content Viewership and Ad Exposure Information for up to three (3) years from the last time our Services encounter a particular device, unless you ask us to delete that information before then. Our cookies are set to expire in less than 13 months. Identifiers associated with your non-Samba TV devices (such as device IDs, mobile ad ids, IP addresses) are kept for no more than 180 days since our last receipt of such identifier.</p><div class="w-embed"><h5><a id="5"></a></h5></div><p>â</p><p>â</p><h2>5.

When we transfer your personal information abroad, we will take appropriate safeguards to protect the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and seek to ensure that overseas recipients comply with applicable privacy laws.</p><p>When we transfer personal data outside of the EEA or Switzerland, we ensure an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects by placing obligations on the recipient of the data pursuant to standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</p><p>Samba TV is also a participant in the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield programs </a>and is committed to the Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer to Third Parties, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, as indicated by our EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield certifications.

Your Choices</h2><p>Below are the choices we provide in connection with the practices described in this Policy.</p><h3><strong>8.1 Smart TV Services</strong></h3><p>We require TV manufacturers to provide you with an opt-in to enable our Smart TV Services that collect Content Viewership Information. This opt-in will usually be presented when you first set up your Smart TV, or after your Smart TV gets a software update that includes our Smart TV Services.</p><p>You should be able to opt in or out of our Smart TV Services at any time your TV is connected to the Internet. You typically can find a feature to opt-out and opt-in in the âsettingsâ menu of your TV; it may also be in the settings menu of the application that integrates our Services. If you have trouble finding this feature, you should contact the TV manufacturer to determine the exact location. If you opt out of our Smart TV Services, we will no longer collect TV viewing information through this service. However, we still may receive Content Viewership Information, as described above in the âCollection of Informationâ section, when you watch content through certain Smart TV Apps. You should review the opt-out options provided by such applications. If you cannot find the opt-out settings, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv.</p><p>You may also choose to enable Limit Ad Tracking from the Privacy menu within Smart TV Settings on your Smart TV. If you do so, our advertising platform will opt your Samba TV Advertising ID out of receiving targeted advertising based on Content Viewing Information from Smart TV Services, regardless of what device you are using. Note that whenever you want to unlink the data associated with your Samba TV Advertising ID, you can simply reset it. Please check with the TV manufacturer for the exact location of these features. If you cannot find them or your TV manufacturer has not enabled them, please contact us at privacy@samba.tv with your TV manufacturer and model number and we will attempt to provide you with more detailed instructions on where to locate these features.</p><p>If you intend to sell or otherwise give away your Smart TV, you should perform a âfactory reset.â This will 1) reset the Samba TV advertising ID, and 2) allow the new owner of the TV to choose whether they want to opt-in or opt-out. If you sell or give away your Smart TV without performing a âfactory reset,â information about the new owner may be incorrectly attributed to you.</p><p>You may also find helpful information about how to opt-out of Smart TV Services and television streaming devices at Network Advertising Initiativeâs web page dedicated to â<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/">Internet Connected TV Choices</a>.â</p><h3><strong>8.2 Interest Based/Tailored Advertising</strong></h3><p>You may learn more about âinterest-basedâ or âtailoredâ advertising, as well as pertinent self-regulatory frameworks by visiting the <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> (âNAIâ) or the <a href="http://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> (âDAAâ). The NAI and DAA are industry associations that develop policies around online consumer privacy in the context of âinterest-basedâ or âtailoredâ advertising.</p><p>Samba TV is an active member of the NAI and the DAA. We adhere to the NAI Code and implement the opt out mechanisms provided by the NAI and DAA:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Web Browsers: </strong>You can opt out of having Samba use your web browsing information for âinterest-basedâ or âtailoredâ advertisements by visiting <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">https://optout.aboutads.info</a>.</li><li><strong>Mobile Devices: </strong>For the most effective and up-to-date methods to limit ad tracking on your mobile device, please refer to your mobile operating system settings to see how you can opt out of âinterest-basedâ or âtailoredâ advertisements, or reset your mobile device advertiser ID to unlink information previously associated with your advertiser ID. Please also review the NAIâs <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice/">mobile opt-out instructions</a> located at mobile-choice. For more information on opting out of targeted advertisements on mobile devices.</li></ul><p>Note, you will need to opt out on each browser on each of your devices.</p><h3><strong>8.3 Cookies And Local Storage</strong></h3><p>If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or to clear local storage. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies or clear local storage, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services and may result in a new Samba TV cookie being created on your browser or device in the future.</p><h3><strong>8.4 Promotional Communications</strong></h3><p>From time to time, we may send you marketing communications about our products and services, in accordance with your preferences. You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us at any time by following the instructions in those messages (often it will be a notice or link at the bottom of the message). Unless restricted by local regulations, we may still send you non-promotional communications about your account following your opt-out.</p><h3><strong>8.5 Mobile Push Notifications</strong></h3><p>With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.</p><div class="w-embed"><h5><a id="9"></a></h5></div><p>â</p><h2>9.
