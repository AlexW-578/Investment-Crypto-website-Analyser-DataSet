During the Subscription Term and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Order, Grammarly grants Customer the right to access and use the Services solely for Customer’s internal business purposes in accordance with the Documentation.
<br/><br/><u>1.2 Use by Affiliates</u>. Customer, at its sole discretion, may permit its Affiliates to access and use any Services purchased by Customer under an Order, provided that such Affiliate access and use the Services in compliance with all of the obligations imposed upon Customer under this Agreement (other than payment obligations), and (ii) Customer remains responsible for the acts and omissions of such Affiliates. If a Customer Affiliate and Grammarly execute a separate Order (an “<b>Affiliate Order</b>”), such Affiliate and Grammarly are deemed (a) to have entered into a separate customer business agreement containing the terms of this Agreement with any reference to “Customer” meaning only such Affiliate (“<b>Affiliate Agreement</b>”) and (b) that Affiliate Order shall be governed by the Affiliate Agreement. Customer is not permitted to resell access to the Services to any of its Affiliates without the prior written consent of Grammarly.<br/><br/><u>1.3 Access for End Users; Responsibility for End Users</u>. Customer may create End User accounts for the Services, in the numbers and types stated in the applicable Order. Each End User account must be designated for use by one individual only. However, ​​an End User account can be transferred to a new individual if the individual previously associated with the account no longer requires access to the Services. Customer is responsible for ensuring End Users’ compliance with this Agreement and the security of End Users’ log-in credentials. Customer must promptly notify Grammarly if it becomes aware of any unauthorized access to any End User’s login credentials or other unauthorized access to or use of the Services. Customer is responsible for providing all legally required notices and obtaining all consents necessary to allow Grammarly to provide the Services to End Users.<br/><br/><u>1.4 Changes to the Services</u>.  Customer acknowledges that the Services are evolving and that Grammarly may modify the features and functionality of the Services during the Subscription Term. Grammarly will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Services purchased by Customer during the Subscription Term. <br/><u></u><br/><u>1.5 Purchase Through Reseller.</u> If Customer subscribes to Services from an authorized Grammarly reseller or partner (“<b>Reseller</b>”), and notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement: (a) the terms of this Agreement will act as the end user license agreement, and in addition to Customer’s compliance with the Agreement, Customer’s right to access and use such Services is subject to the terms and conditions of Customer’s written agreement with the Reseller (“<b>Reseller Agreement</b>”), including Customer’s obligation to timely pay Fees to the Reseller; (b) Customer will execute all Orders directly with the Reseller and not Grammarly; and (c) the terms and conditions of Section 2 (<i>Payment Terms</i>) do not apply.

Furthermore, Customer’s right to terminate or cancel its Service is solely as described in the Reseller Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall be interpreted as permitting Reseller to offer terms inconsistent with the remainder of this Agreement. If the Reseller ceases at any time to be an authorized Reseller, including for a failure to pay for any Services, Customer’s continued use of Services may be conditioned upon Customer executing a written agreement for such Services directly with Grammarly, and paying the outstanding Fees, if any, that Reseller did not remit to Grammarly on Customer’s behalf. Resellers are not authorized to modify the Agreement or make any promises or commitments on Grammarly’s behalf, and Grammarly is not bound by any obligations to Customer other than as set forth in this Agreement.

Third-Party Packs may be offered free of charge or for a fee, either charged directly by the Third-Party Pack provider or by Grammarly. When Grammarly charges Customer on behalf of the Third-Party Pack provider, Customer acknowledges that Grammarly acts only as an intermediary in facilitating or collecting the applicable fees and taxes from Customer. All payment-related matters, including fee payment, renewal, and refund policies, are between the Customer and the Third-Party Pack provider and are governed by the Third-Party Terms.
<br/><br/><u>1.6.5 Third-Party Data Flow</u>.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AGREEMENT, GRAMMARLY WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.<br/><u></u><br/><u>1.7 Beta Services</u>. <!-- -->Grammarly may occasionally provide Customer access to new service offerings still in development (“<b>Beta Services</b>”). Grammarly will clearly designate all Beta Services as “alpha,” “beta,” “early access,” or something similar in the applicable Services or Documentation.

This indemnification obligation will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from (a) Customer’s breach of this Agreement; (b) a modification or combination of the Services by Customer with materials not provided by Grammarly under this Agreement, unless such modification or combination is required by this Agreement; or (c) Services provided under a free trial or program. For third-party infringement claims related to Output generated by the Service, Grammarly’s indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent (a) the Customer Content used to generate the allegedly infringing Output independently infringes or misappropriates a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights or could reasonably be expected to elicit infringing Output from the Service; (b) Customer modifies, uses or distributes the Output in a manner that is reasonably likely to infringe or misappropriate a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights; or (c) a third party alleges that the Output violates that third party’s trademark or other related rights.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Customer will defend Grammarly against any third-party legal proceedings and will indemnify Grammarly against Indemnified Amounts to the extent arising from (a) Customer Data or (b) Customer&#x27;s and Customer&#x27;s End Users’ access or use of the Services in breach of this Agreement. The indemnification obligations will not apply to the extent the underlying allegation arises from Grammarly’s breach of this Agreement.

The indemnified party must promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of any allegation(s) that preceded the third-party legal proceeding and cooperate reasonably with the indemnifying party to resolve the allegation(s) and third-party legal proceeding. With respect to any allegation that an Output infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Rights, Customer will use reasonable efforts to cease its use, display, and dissemination of such Output immediately upon receipt of notice of the allegation, and the parties will work together in good faith to mitigate any additional infringement claims. If breach of this notification obligation prejudices the defense of the legal proceeding, the indemnifying party&#x27;s obligations will be reduced in proportion to the prejudice.

The indemnified party must give sole control of the indemnified portion of the third-party legal proceeding to the indemnifying party, subject to the following: (a) the indemnified party may appoint its own non-controlling counsel, at its own expense; and (b) any settlement requiring the indemnified party to admit liability, pay money, or take (or refrain from taking) any action, will require the indemnified party&#x27;s prior written consent, which is not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.<br/><br/><u>10.5 Remedies</u>. If Grammarly reasonably believes the Services might infringe a third party&#x27;s Intellectual Property Rights, then Grammarly may, at its sole option and expense (a) procure the right for Customer to continue using the Services; (b) modify the Services to make them non-infringing without materially reducing their functionality; or (c) replace the Services with a non-infringing, functionally equivalent alternative.
