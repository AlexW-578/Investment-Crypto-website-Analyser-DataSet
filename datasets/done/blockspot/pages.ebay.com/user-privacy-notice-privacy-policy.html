<h3>5.6 Data Sharing between eBay Affiliates</h3>

<p>As set out above under "Personal data from other sources", we also receive access to personal data about you from other eBay Affiliates. This enables us, in particular, to provide you, with your consent as legally required, with information about products and services, which we believe might interest you, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising by analyzing your use of the services of eBay Affiliates, in particular through the matching of certain data (e.g. cookie IDs).

<p>Some recipients of your personal data are located outside your jurisdiction or have offices in jurisdictions where data protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in your jurisdiction. When transferring personal data to such recipients, we provide appropriate safeguards.</p>

<div class="hide">
<h3>6.1 Data transfers to eBay Affiliates</h3>

<p>The transmission of personal data between eBay Affiliates (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU for transfers from the EEA). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, eBay Affiliates undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/company/privacy-center/" target="_blank">eBay Privacy Center<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the EEA, UK or Switzerland to third countries)</h3>

<p>We may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section <a href="#section8">5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients</a>) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States (Data Privacy Framework) and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. Additional information regarding the measures taken by us is available <a href="#section3">on request</a>.

<h2 id="section7" style="display: inline-block;">7. Storage duration and erasure</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href="#section5">5. Purposes and legal bases&nbsp;for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more about section 7</h3>

<div class="hide">
<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br />
	This includes such things as executing the <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br />
	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br />
	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>

<h2 id="section10" style="display: inline-block;">10. Data security</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>We protect your personal data through technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure and alteration. To this end we use network security services and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and logical access controls for data and systems access.

<div class="line"></div>

<h2 id="section11">11. Other important information regarding data protection</h2>

<p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more about section 11</h3>

<div class="hide">
<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p>

<h3>Use of our Services through third-party applications</h3>

<p>If you use our Services from within a third-party application, that application may also collect your data in accordance with their separate privacy policies. When accessing our Services from a web browser within a third-party application (e.g. Facebook's in-app browser), you should also review that application's privacy policy for information about the application's processing of your personal data.</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3>

<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</h3>

<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> (including any of our <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</h3>

<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and/or to comply with legal obligations. For example, under the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described in our User Privacy Notice and in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>, we may share this data with other eBay Affiliates in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<h3>Staying Signed in</h3>

<p>When you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bid, buy or make an offer on an item</li>
	<li>Check out or add items to your cart</li>
	<li>Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)</li>
	<li>View the activity header</li>
	<li>View the My eBay page</li>
	<li>View or edit the Watchlist or order details</li>
	<li>View the profile page</li>
	<li>Send member-to-member messages</li>
	<li>Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims</li>
</ul>

<p>If you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.</p>

<p>You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.</p>

<h3>Blockchain and Controllership</h3>

<p>Certain features in our marketplace may enable tokens, smart contracts, and/or other digital assets (e.g. immutable tokens for eBay Authenticity Certificates) to be deployed to a public blockchain with your separate agreement to certain terms and conditions. Please note that notwithstanding other provisions in this User Privacy Notice addressing data controllership, the blockchain is an inherently public and decentralized infrastructure that cannot be controlled by any one person or group and is therefore outside of our ability to control. For example, details of blockchain-based transactions are immutable and cannot be deleted by any one person or group.</p>

<p>To the extent that certain Services involve personal data processed on eBay websites or applications such as through account or wallet registration, customer service interactions, or marketing activities, one of the eBay Affiliates is responsible for the processing of your personal data depending on the region in which you reside (see section <a href="#section2">2. Controller</a> above). Such eBay Affiliate is also the controller for its independent activities involving your personal data on the blockchain to verify and manage risk involving digital wallets or to enable features for brands, collectors, sellers, traders, or such eBay Affiliate for user engagement or marketing purposes. By contrast, neither eBay Inc. nor an eBay Affiliate is the controller for activities you choose to conduct via the blockchain, publicly visible digital wallets, or other decentralized networks (e.g.&nbsp;which allow you to engage in transactions on public blockchains and which inherently involve personal data placed on the public blockchain ledger). In addition, we may engage third-party partners who may act as independent data controllers to assist to facilitate transactions you request, and your interactions with that third-party partner as an independent data controller are governed by the applicable terms of service and privacy policy of that third party.</p>

<h2 id="section12">12. eBay and AI</h2>

<h3>Responsible AI</h3>

<p>We are committed to developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly, ensuring that we use AI to enhance the eBay experience and respect the needs of the entire eBay community. To achieve this, we have invested in a robust Responsible AI (RAI) approach at eBay which leverages the RAI principles set out in our <a href="https://static.ebayinc.com/assets/Uploads/Documents/Responsible-AI-Policy.pdf" target="_blank">RAI Policy<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>. These principles direct the development, deployment, and use of AI at eBay.</p>

<h3>Use of AI</h3>

<p>We may use AI-powered tools and products for various purposes, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To improve and enhance our Services.</li>
	<li>To offer you new or enhanced features and products (such as AI-powered listing generation, image background enhancement, and AI assistants).</li>
	<li>To make information about listings and services more accessible, such as by offering AI-generated summaries of product reviews.</li>
	<li>To offer you a more customized and personalized experience.</li>
	<li>To provide you with enhanced customer service, for example, to bring real-time answers to chat, to analyze customer service interactions to improve their quality or to better understand customer pain points, and to help respond to customer queries.</li>
	<li>To support fraud detection, and compliance checks, and to detect suspicious activity on our properties.</li>
	<li>To analyze data for specific patterns (e.g. for market research purposes).</li>
	<li>To support us in our day-to-day work (e.g. to create summaries, to translate text or to generate images).</li>
</ul>

<p>AI-powered tools and products may involve personal data processing, but this is not necessarily the case. We use both our own AI models and third-party AI models and systems to deliver AI-powered tools and products. If our use of AI involves the processing of personal data, we rely on the legal bases set out in Section <a href="#section5">5. Purposes and legal bases for data processing and categories of recipients</a> above for the purposes mentioned therein. If we use any AI system that interacts directly with you, we will let you know.</p>

<h3>AI development and training</h3>

<p>Where permitted under applicable law, we use personal data collected from our users to train, test, validate, and align our own AI models as well as third-party AI models and systems that we use for the purposes outlined in this User Privacy Notice. This may include the personal data set out in Section <a href="#section4">4. What personal data we collect and process</a>. We may combine personal data from our users with data from external sources (e.g. from publicly available sources). The use of personal data for AI development and training is based on our legitimate interest to achieve the objectives outlined under "Use of AI" above.</p>

<p>When training, testing, validating, and aligning AI models, we take appropriate steps to mitigate potential privacy impacts (e.g. through filtering, data masking, differential privacy techniques). Where applicable, our steps are based on data protection impact assessments and the legitimate interest assessment that we carry out. These take into account the purpose of the model, the need and suitability of certain training data, as well as measures that can be reasonably taken during training and thereafter.</p>

<h3>AI-related individual rights</h3>

<p>You have rights with regard to your personal data. See Section <a href="#section8">8. Rights as a data subject</a> above for more details. Your rights also include the <a href="https://accountsettings.ebay.com/ai-preferences" target="_blank">right to object<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> to our processing of your personal data for AI development and training purposes.</p>

<div class="hide">
<h3>6.1 Data transfers to eBay Affiliates</h3>

<p>The transmission of personal data between eBay Affiliates (e.g. to enable cross border transactions and for other legally permitted purposes) is based on our worldwide data protection principles, which are binding internal data protection regulations (Binding Corporate Rules, BCRs), or on the basis of other appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard data protection clauses issued or approved by the European Commission (2021/914/EU). Through our Binding Corporate Rules, eBay Affiliates undertake to protect your personal data and to comply with data protection obligations. Further information on our binding company-wide guidelines and our worldwide data protection principles can be found in the <a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/company/privacy-center/" target="_blank">eBay Privacy Center<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>.</p>

<h3>6.2 Other data transfers (from the European Economic Area to third countries)</h3>

<p>We may transfer your personal data to recipients (see section 5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients) who may be located anywhere in the world. We will only transfer your personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom or Switzerland to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EEA, on the basis of appropriate safeguards or if otherwise authorized by applicable law. Third countries providing an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission currently include Andorra, Argentina, Canada (for companies covered by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act), Switzerland (for transfers out of the EEA), the Faroe Islands, Guernsey, the State of Israel, the Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, New Zealand, South Korea, the United Kingdom, the United States (Data Privacy Framework) and Uruguay. In other cases, eBay provides the necessary safeguards, e.g. through the conclusion of data protection contracts adopted by the European Commission (e.g. standard data protection clauses (2021/914/EU) with the recipients, or through other measures provided for by law. Additional information regarding the measures taken by us is available <a href="#3">on request</a>.

<h2 id="7" style="display: inline-block;">7. Storage duration and erasure</h2>
&nbsp;

<p>Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy Notice (see section <a href="#5">5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and categories of recipients</a> for more information on the processing purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in accordance with our data retention and deletion policy or take steps to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged or permitted to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax, accounting or auditing purposes, or to detect and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity on eBay). In Europe, the retention periods are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts, notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in particular to cases where we may still need the data for the execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant limitation or retention periods have expired.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more about section 7</h3>

<div class="hide">
<p>The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal obligations under applicable national law. The following factors typically affect the retention period:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services</strong><br />
	This includes such things as executing the User Agreement with you, maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on the basis of this general rule.</li>
	<li><strong>Consent-based processing of personal data</strong><br />
	If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as necessary in order to process it according to your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations</strong><br />
	Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes. Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on national law.</li>

<p>Your rights in detail:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where we rely on consent you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> to the processing of your personal data by us at any time. As a result, we may no longer process your personal data based on this consent in the future. The withdrawal of consent has no effect on the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain <strong>access</strong> to your personal data that is being processed by us. In particular, you may request information on the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, the categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed, where possible the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored or the criteria used to determine that period, the existence of the right to request rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data or to object to such processing, the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, any available information as to the personal data's source (where they are not collected from you), the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and, where appropriate, meaningful information on its details. Your right to access shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Your right to access may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us without undue delay the <strong>rectification</strong> of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us the <strong>erasure</strong> of personal data concerning you under certain conditions (e.g. when the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were processed or when they are no longer required for overriding legitimate grounds, such as the detection/prevention of fraud), unless processing is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obligation, for reasons of public interest or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The right to erasure may be limited by national law.</li>
	<li>You have the right to obtain from us <strong>restriction of processing your personal data</strong> to the extent that
	<ul>
		<li>the accuracy of the data is disputed by you,</li>
		<li>the processing is unlawful, but you oppose the erasure of the personal data,</li>
		<li>we no longer need the data, but you need it to assert, exercise or defend legal claims or</li>
		<li>you have objected to the processing.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller ("<strong>right to data portability</strong>").</li>
	<li>You have the right to lodge a complaint with a <strong>supervisory authority</strong>. As a rule, you can contact the supervisory authority of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the registered office of the <a href="#2">controller</a>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="policy-highlight-warning">
<p>If your personal data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests, you have the <strong>right to object</strong> to the processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation. This also applies to profiling. If your personal data is processed by us for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>We protect your personal data through technical and organizational security measures to minimize risks associated with data loss, misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure and alteration. To this end we use network security services and data encryption, for example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data centers and logical access controls for data and systems access.

<h2 id="11">11. Other important information regarding data protection</h2>

<p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.</p>

<div class="expand_collapse_list">
<h3 class="title">Learn more about section 11</h3>

<div class="hide">
<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?</h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.</p>

<p>When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).</p>

<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay</h3>

<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>

<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.</p>

<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal data relating to third parties</h3>

<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.</p>

<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools</h3>

<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> (including any of our <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.</p>

<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href="/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a> and our other <a href="/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205">rules and policies</a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href="/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay</a>.</p>

<h3>Use of Artificial Intelligence or AI-Powered Tools</h3>

<p>We may use artificial intelligence or AI-powered tools and products to improve our Services, to offer you new or enhanced features, a customized and personalized experience, to provide you with enhanced customer service, and to support fraud detection.</p>

<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?</h3>

<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> and/or to comply with legal obligations. For example, under the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> you must provide us with certain identification information including legal name, date of birth, and tax identification number or social security number so that we may fulfill our legal "Know Your Customer" (KYC) obligations. As described in our User Privacy Notice and in the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html" target="_blank">Payments Terms of Use<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a>, we may share this data with other eBay Affiliates in order to facilitate transactions and with service providers, including payment processors, credit agencies and bureaus. Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.</p>

<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>

<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.</p>

<h3>Staying Signed in</h3>

<p>When you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.</p>

<p>You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.</p>

For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Use of our Services through third-party applications\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If you use our Services from within a third-party application, that application may also collect your data in accordance with their separate privacy policies. When accessing our Services from a web browser within a third-party application (e.g. Facebook's in-app browser), you should also review that application's privacy policy for information about the application's processing of your personal data.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates.

All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service. In the event of a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a> (including any of our <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\">rules and policies\u003C/a>), we reserve the right to block the transmission of the message and to restrict the purchase and sales functions of your eBay account or to block your eBay account.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>This is to protect our legitimate interests such as protecting against fraudulent or suspicious activities (e.g. spam, viruses, phishing, or other illegal activities) or enforcing our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a> and our other <a href=\"/help/policies/default/ebay-rules-policies?id=4205\">rules and policies\u003C/a> (e.g. illegal and other prohibited content), including but not limited to enforcing the <a href=\"/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272\">prohibition of purchases and sales outside of eBay\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Are you obliged to provide your personal data to us?\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Some of the personal data that you provide to us (e.g. data by which we can identify you) are required to enter into the User Agreement and the <a href=\"https://pages.ebay.com/payment/2.0/terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">Payments Terms of Use<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a> and/or to comply with legal obligations.

Although the provision of any other personal data (e.g. address and shipping data) is voluntary, it may be necessary for the use of our Services, such as bidding, purchase and sales data to complete a transaction.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Children's Privacy\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Our services are not intended for the use by children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from users who are considered children under applicable national laws. Under our User Agreement, children are not permitted to use our Services.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Staying Signed in\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you sign into your account on our Services, we give you the option to stay signed into your account for a certain amount of time. If you are using a public or shared computer, we encourage you to decline. You or any other user of the computer/browser you signed in on will be able to view and access most parts of your account and take certain specific actions during this signed in period without any further authorization. The specific actions and account activities that you or any other user of this computer/browser may take include:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Bid, buy or make an offer on an item\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Check out or add items to your cart\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Purchase an item with PayPal using Faster Checkout (if enabled in your account)\u003C/li>\n\t<li>View the activity header\u003C/li>\n\t<li>View the My eBay page\u003C/li>\n\t<li>View or edit the Watchlist or order details\u003C/li>\n\t<li>View the profile page\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Send member-to-member messages\u003C/li>\n\t<li>Conduct after-sale activities, like leaving feedback, canceling orders, requesting returns or submitting claims\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<p>If you attempt to change your password or username, update any other account information or attempt other account activity beyond those listed above, you may be required to enter your password.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You can typically end your signed in session by either signing out and/or clearing your cookies. If you have certain browser privacy settings enabled, simply closing your browser may also end your signed in session. If you are using a public or shared computer, you should sign out and/or clear your cookies when you are done using our Services to protect your account and your personal data.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Blockchain and Controllership\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Certain features in our marketplace may enable tokens, smart contracts, and/or other digital assets (e.g. immutable tokens for eBay Authenticity Certificates) to be deployed to a public blockchain with your separate agreement to certain terms and conditions. Please note that notwithstanding other provisions in this User Privacy Notice addressing data controllership, the blockchain is an inherently public and decentralized infrastructure that cannot be controlled by any one person or group and is therefore outside of our ability to control. For example, details of blockchain-based transactions are immutable and cannot be deleted by any one person or group.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To the extent that certain Services involve personal data processed on eBay websites or applications such as through account or wallet registration, customer service interactions, or marketing activities, one of the eBay Affiliates is responsible for the processing of your personal data depending on the region in which you reside (see section <a href=\"#section2\">2. Controller\u003C/a> above). Such eBay Affiliate is also the controller for its independent activities involving your personal data on the blockchain to verify and manage risk involving digital wallets or to enable features for brands, collectors, sellers, traders, or such eBay Affiliate for user engagement or marketing purposes. By contrast, neither eBay Inc. nor an eBay Affiliate is the controller for activities you choose to conduct via the blockchain, publicly visible digital wallets, or other decentralized networks (e.g.&nbsp;which allow you to engage in transactions on public blockchains and which inherently involve personal data placed on the public blockchain ledger). In addition, we may engage third-party partners who may act as independent data controllers to assist to facilitate transactions you request, and your interactions with that third-party partner as an independent data controller are governed by the applicable terms of service and privacy policy of that third party.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/div>\n\n<div class=\"line\">\u003C/div>\n\n<h2 id=\"section12\">12. eBay and AI\u003C/h2>\n\n<h3>Responsible AI\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>We are committed to developing and using artificial intelligence (AI) responsibly, ensuring that we use AI to enhance the eBay experience and respect the needs of the entire eBay community.

Other important information regarding data protection\u003C/h2>\n\n<p>This section contains important additional information about the protection of personal data in connection with the use of our Services, including whether you are required to provide personal data.\u003C/p>\n\n<div class=\"expand_collapse_list\">\n<h3 class=\"title\">Learn more about section 11\u003C/h3>\n\n<div class=\"hide\">\n<h3>What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or applications?\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay or disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, saved interests, sellers and searches, storefronts, feedback, ratings, product reviews and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you choose to share in your profile.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>When you use our Services, your public username may be displayed and available to the public and associated with all of your public eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites may refer to your public username and specific items. Accordingly, if you use a username that allows others to identify you, these others may be able to identify your eBay activities.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>To help protect your personal data, we allow only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other's name, username, (alias) email address and other contact and shipping information. For example, we may allow users to exchange telephone numbers in order to contact each other prior to completing a transaction (e.g. a seller may opt to share their telephone number with a buyer so that the buyer may call with questions about a listed item). In this case, sellers are prohibited from using a buyer's telephone number for other purposes (e.g. completing a transaction off eBay or adding the buyer to a marketing list).\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Your responsibilities over transactional information you receive through eBay\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>When you complete a transaction with another user (or a transaction has been canceled, failed, or subsequently invalidated), we will provide you with the other user's personal data (such as name, username, (alias) email address, contact information, shipping and billing information, or return address). Independent from us, you are the controller of such data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we have shared this data with you, including compliance with any limitations imposed by this User Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g. give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by you and demand that it be erased.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>You may only use the personal data that you have access to for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other Services offered through eBay (such as shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent, constitutes a violation of our <a href=\"/help/policies/member-behavior-policies/user-agreement?id=4259\">User Agreement\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Personal data relating to third parties\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our User Privacy Notice.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Filtering of messages sent via our messaging tools\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>All messages sent via our messaging tools (including chat messages and emails sent to eBay alias email addresses) are first received by us and then forwarded to the recipient. All messages are automatically filtered according to certain criteria. If necessary, conspicuous messages are checked manually by our customer service.
