        <h2>Software as a Service Agreement</h2>
<p>This Software as a Service Agreement and related schedules (“<strong>SaaS</strong>”) is effective as of the earlier of: (a) the last date of the signature of this SaaS; and (b) the last date of the signature of the first Order Form (defined below) (the “<strong>Effective Date</strong>”), by and between the entity named below and each of its Affiliates entering into an Order Form (“<strong>Client</strong>”) and either Riskified, Inc., or Riskified Ltd., as set out in Section 13 (“<strong>Riskified</strong>”). Each of Riskified and Client are individually referred to as a “<strong>Party</strong>” and collectively as the “<strong>Parties</strong>”.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3><strong>Riskified responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provision of Services</span>. Riskified will make the Services available to Client, as described in this SaaS and related order forms with schedules (each, an “<strong>Order Form</strong>”, and with the SaaS, the “<strong>Agreement</strong>”). Each Client Affiliate receiving the Services shall execute a separate Order Form. “<strong>Services</strong>” means the products and services provided by Riskified and/or its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, by executing an Order Form, each Client Affiliate shall be bound to this SaaS. “<strong>Affiliate</strong>” means any entity that directly or indirectly Controls, is Controlled by, or is under common Control with the subject entity. “<strong>Control</strong>” for purposes of this definition, means direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 50% of the voting interests and/or management of the subject entity.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Support</span>. Riskified, at its own expense, will provide Client with technical support in accordance with Riskified’s standard practices.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Security and Data Protection Program</span>. Riskified will maintain physical, administrative, and technical safeguards consistent with industry-accepted practices including the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001:2013 and a System and Organizational Controls (SOC) 2, Type II report to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Client Data (defined below). The Parties will adhere to the terms of the Data Processing Addendum (“<strong>DPA</strong>”), available at <a href="https://security.riskified.com/">https://security.riskified.com/</a>, which is incorporated herein by reference, with respect to any “personal data” or “personal information”, as such terms are defined by applicable law, that are processed in connection with the Agreement, unless the Parties have executed a separate data processing addendum, which shall prevail. Riskified reserves the right to update such measures, as set forth at <a href="https://security.riskified.com/">https://security.riskified.com/</a>, provided that any updates shall not materially diminish the level of security applicable to the Services. Client is responsible for reviewing the information Riskified makes available regarding its data processing and security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Client’s requirements and legal obligations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Client Responsibilities</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Use Restrictions</span>. Except for the rights granted in the Agreement, no other rights in or to any Services, express, implied or otherwise, are granted to Client. Without limiting the foregoing, Client shall not, and shall not allow, directly or through a third party to: (i) use the Services other than for the purpose permitted herein; (ii) transfer, sell, rent, lease or share the Services or the results, including recommendations; (iii) permit any person who is not an Authorized User (defined below) to use or access the Services or the results thereof; (iv) attempt to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works from, frame, mirror, republish, download, display, transmit, or distribute all or any portion of Riskified&#8217;s online software application provided as part of the Services; (v) attempt to reverse compile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise reduce to human-perceivable form all or any part of the Services; (vi) access the Services or use the results thereof in order to build, improve upon, develop a product or service which competes with the Services or frustrates the purpose of the Agreement; (vii) make available to Riskified any data regulated under PCI; (viii) use the Services or provide data to Riskified in a manner that violates any applicable law, ordinance, regulation or administrative order; or (ix) take any action that imposes or may impose (as determined in Riskified’s reasonable discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on the servers, API, network, bandwidth, or other cloud infrastructure which operate or support the Services, or otherwise systematically abuse or disrupt the integrity of such servers, network, bandwidth, or infrastructure, including but not limited to API calls exceeding a volume of 700% of Client’s daily average of API calls (or such other volume reasonably determined by Riskified), all as reasonably measured by Riskified.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Client Security Standards and Data Protection</span>. Client shall establish and maintain a data security and protection program that includes physical, technical, administrative, and organizational safeguards no less rigorous than accepted industry practices and as required by applicable law, that is designed to ensure the access to, and security of, the Client Data, Client’s platform and systems, as well as any integrations associated therewith, and as reasonably requested by Riskified. Client is solely responsible for all aspects of Client Data, including its sourcing, inputting, accuracy, quality, integrity and management and maintaining reasonable security measures with respect to the Client Data while in its possession and control.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Client IT Infrastructure</span>. Client is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining network connections and telecommunications links from its systems to Riskified, and for all problems, conditions, delays, delivery failures, as well as all other loss or damage arising from or relating to Client&#8217;s network connections or telecommunications links or caused by the internet. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Riskified is not responsible for technical issues due to Client’s failure to comply with Riskified’s instructions; or modification or alteration of the Services by any anyone other than Riskified or Riskified’s duly authorized contractors or agents.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Audit; Competition</span>. Client agrees to provide its reasonable cooperation in the event Riskified audits Client’s use of the Service, which may occur only upon reasonable advance notice, during Client’s business hours, not more than once per calendar year or in connection with a breach of the Agreement. For the Term of the Agreement (defined below), Client agrees that it shall not receive third party fraud mitigation services.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authorized Users; Credentialing</span>. Only those users authorized by Client may use the Services (each, an “<strong>Authorized User</strong>”). Any violation of the Agreement by an Authorized User shall be deemed to be a violation by Client. Client is solely responsible for the security and proper creation, use and termination of all Authorized User names, passwords and other security devices used in connection with the Services and shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that they are kept confidential and secure, are used properly and are not disclosed to unauthorized persons. Client shall immediately notify Riskified in writing if there is any reason to believe that any security credentials or any other security device has or was likely compromised or used in an unauthorized way. Riskified may require Client to change any of its Authorized User’s usernames, passwords or other security devices used by Client in connection with the Services, and Client shall promptly comply with any such requirement.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fair Credit Reporting Ac</span>t. Client acknowledges that Riskified, is not a consumer-reporting agency as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. §1681 et seq.

Client represents and warrants that it shall not use the Services to determine any consumer’s eligibility for any product or service to be used by a consumer for personal, family or household purposes. Further, Client represents and warrants that it shall not use the Services in whole or in part: (i) as a factor in establishing a consumer’s eligibility for credit; (ii) as a factor in establishing a consumer’s eligibility for insurance; (iii) for employment purposes; (iv) in connection with a determination of an individual’s eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental authority; or (v) in connection with any permissible purpose as defined by the FCRA.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sanctions; Compliance</span>. Client acknowledges the Services do not guarantee compliance with any specific law or regulation. Client represents and warrants that: (1) neither Client, nor any of its directors, officers, employees, Authorized Users, customers and/or end-users: (a) is subject to sanctions and/or named as specifically designated national on the most current list published by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Asset Control (&#8220;<strong>OFAC</strong>&#8220;) at its official website (&#8220;<strong>Prohibited Persons</strong>&#8220;), or (b) are located, organized, or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose government is, the target of sanctions imposed by OFAC (&#8220;<strong>Sanctioned Area</strong>&#8220;) and (2) Client implements appropriate controls designed to comply with sanctions regulations, including but not limited to OFAC.</li>

Except as otherwise specified in an Order Form, the term for each Order Form shall be for one (1) year (the “<strong>Initial Term</strong>”).

In the event of Early Termination, Client shall pay Riskified an amount equal to the gross average monthly Fees invoiced by Riskified and multiplied by the number of months remaining in the then-current Term (“<strong>Early Termination Fee</strong>”), which will be reduced by any and all credits owed to Client in the final invoice. Client acknowledges and agrees that the Early Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty and that the amount of actual loss due to the foregoing is difficult to precisely estimate and the amount of liquidated damages bears a reasonable proportion to the probable loss that Riskified will suffer in relation to the foregoing.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination for Breach</span>.

<p class="p1"><strong>This Vendor Code of Conduct (“Code”) sets forth Riskified’s expectation that its Vendors uphold the highest standards of ethics and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">These expectations should complement each Vendor’s own company policies, applicable legal requirements, and the terms of any agreements that a Vendor may have with Riskified. Failure to comply with this Code could result in termination of the business relationship. Riskified encourages Vendors to raise questions or concerns about this Code to their Riskified point of contact.</p>
<p class="p1">Riskified’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets forth our compliance standards in more detail, is available at <a href="https://ir.riskified.com/corporate-governance/documents-charters">https://ir.riskified.com/corporate-governance/documents-charters </a>Riskified expects its Vendors to be honest, ethical and transparent when dealing with Riskified, its employees, customers and other third parties.</p>
