If you do not see the NPR+ bundle option when you visit plus.npr.org that means the NPR+ bundle is not currently available in your area. </p>   <p>The NPR+ bundle does not constitute a Subscription Service, as that term is used and defined above in these Terms of Use – rather, it is a thank-you gift that NPR is providing in recognition of donations made to participating NPR stations via plus.npr.org. </p>   <p>When you choose the NPR+ bundle, you are making a tax-free gift to directly support public radio in your area. If you select the NPR bundle option and become a member of your local NPR station via plus.npr.org, your monthly or annual recurring donation will automatically be charged by the NPR station you select, using the payment method you provided at the time of your initial donation.

The NPR+ Benefits are a thank-you gift that NPR is providing in recognition of donations made to participating NPR stations via plus.npr.org.</p>   <p>NPR will make the NPR+ Benefits available to you for so long as you continue your recurring donation to your selected station, unless your selected NPR station elects to stop participating in NPR+, in which case the station will notify you that your NPR+ Benefits will be ending. </p>   <p><strong><em>How to Cancel</em></strong></p>   <p>You may cancel your recurring donation at any time by contacting your selected NPR station directly or by logging into your NPR+ account and using the account management tools we provide to you.
