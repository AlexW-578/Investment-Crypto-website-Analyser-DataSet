Certain Cisco websites and Solutions may have their own privacy documentation describing how we handle Personal Data for those websites or Solutions specifically.

              <h2 id="use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies" class="mt-20">Use of cookies and similar technologies</h2>
              <p>Cisco uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, embedded web links, pixels, tags, and web beacons. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to us (such as Internet Protocol [IP] address, MAC address, clickstream behavior, and telemetry).</p>
              <p>These tools help make your visit to our websites and Solutions easier, more efficient, and personalized. We also use the information to improve our websites and Solutions, provide greater service and value, better understand your potential interest in our websites and Solutions, and provide you with more relevant ads and other content.</p>
              <p>We partner with third parties to display advertising on our website and to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third-party partners may use cookies or similar technologies to provide you with advertising based on your browsing activities and interests.

Manual review may be conducted by Cisco employees or trusted third-party business partners working on Cisco's behalf.</p>
              <h2 id="linked-websites" class="mt-20">Linked websites</h2>
