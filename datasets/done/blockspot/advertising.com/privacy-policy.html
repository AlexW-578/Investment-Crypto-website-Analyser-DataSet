          visitors' usage patterns. We use aggregated information to improve our content and product offerings, operate
          our Services, and to better understand our audience as we develop new products and services. We may also share

          with our subsidiaries (“Corporate Affiliates”) who may use this information to contact you with information
          and offers they believe will be of interest to you. The Corporate Affiliates' use of your Personal Information
          is subject to the Advertising.com Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with Law or Protection of Rights</span>. We may disclose
          information we collect, including your Personal Information, when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is
          appropriate to comply with the law, a court order, or a subpoena. We may also disclose your Personal

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Negotiations</span>. We may contemplate, for strategic or
          other reasons, selling, buying, merging, or otherwise reorganizing our businesses. In negotiating with a third
          party about entering into such an arrangement, we may need to disclose your Personal Information. In such
          cases, we will take reasonable measures to protect the Personal Information we disclose, for example, by
          requiring a prospective partner or purchaser to sign a non-disclosure agreement limiting the use and
          protecting the confidentiality of the information.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span>. We may transfer the information you
          submit on or through the Services, including Personal Information, to a partner or buyer or other successor in

          an affiliated company about our Site's users is among the assets transferred.</p>

        <p><u>Vendors</u>. We may from time to time retain third-party vendors in order to help us manage the Services
          and allow us to better serve our visitors and customers. These may include third-party vendors we engage to
          analyze the information we collect for marketing or similar purposes.</p>

        <p>We may contract with third parties who use cookies or third-party identifiers to collect information on our
          behalf. These parties maintain their own confidentiality and security standards. We may contract with
          companies or others to provide certain services, including payment services, data management and promotional

        <p><em>Service Providers</em>. We may also share information, including Personal Information, to third-party
          vendors to help us provide the Services. For example, we may use a cloud-service provider to host information
          we collect or other aspects of our Services. Such vendors have access to Personal Information for a limited
          purpose and for a limited period of time and are required by contract to protect the confidentiality of the
          Personal Information we share with them and to use it only to perform activities on our behalf</p>

        <p><em>Other Business Partners and Selected Vendors</em>. We work closely with certain business partners and
          carefully selected vendors to provide you with access to their products and other offerings. We may share

          information to offer you products that they believe will be of interest to you or to address any questions or
          concerns that you may have about their products.</p>

            Information to fulfill our obligations under a contract to which you are a party (e.g., to provide you with
            our products and services), you might not be able to object to this processing, or if you do choose to
