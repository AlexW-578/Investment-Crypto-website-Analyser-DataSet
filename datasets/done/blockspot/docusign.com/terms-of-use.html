PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. THIS SECTION IS SUBJECT TO ANY APPLICABLE TERMS IN SECTION 11 (SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND OTHER REGIONS)</b></p><p><b>10.7.1.</b>  You agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 10.7 (Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class Actions) is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property as provided in Section 10.7.10.</p><p><b>10.7.2.</b>  <b>Initial Dispute Resolution.</b> Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action you will contact us at legal@docusign.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to a Docusign Services account). Except for intellectual property, you and we agree to use reasonable efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with us, and good faith negotiations will be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p><p><b>10.7.3.</b>  <b>Binding Arbitration.</b> If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided below) subject to these Terms. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties&#x27; relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Site or information we supply will be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p><p><b>10.7.4.</b>  <b>Arbitrator’s Powers.</b> The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&#x27;s award will be written and will be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p><p><b>10.7.5.</b>  <b>Filing a Demand.</b> To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/"> <u>www.jamsadr.com</u></a>); (b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, California, 94111; and (c) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at: <u>legal@docusign.com</u>.</p><p><b>10.7.6.</b>  <b>Fees &amp; Costs.</b> If your claim(s) total is less than US $5,000.00, then: (a) you may choose whether your participation in the arbitration will be conducted on the basis of documents provided to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing; (b) Docusign will reimburse your filing fees up to a maximum of US $1,500.00 unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous; and (c) Docusign will not seek attorney’s fees and costs, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous. You are responsible for your own attorneys&#x27; fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p><p><b>10.7.7.</b>  <b>No Jury Trial.</b> The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration section, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p><p><b>10.7.8.</b>  <b>Venue.</b> Arbitration will be initiated and take place in San Francisco, California, United States, and you and Docusign agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p><p><b>10.7.9.</b>  <b>Class Action Waiver.</b> The parties further agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND DOCUSIGN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above will be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties will be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p><p><b>10.7.10. Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property.</b> Notwithstanding the parties&#x27; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in any state, or federal court or other governing body or authority with lawful jurisdiction for such disputes, or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).</p><p><b>10.7.11. Survival.</b> This Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class Actions section will survive any termination of your use of the Site or information we supply.</p><p><b>10.8.</b>  <b>Entire Terms.</b> These Terms, which include the language and paragraphs preceding Section 1, are the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the agreement between you and Docusign regarding the Docusign Services provided under these Terms.

Notwithstanding your and Docusign’s agreement to mandatory arbitration, either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, CA, as necessary to protect the party&#x27;s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. You and Docusign submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco, California, U.S.A.</p><p><b>10.10. Language and Translations.</b> Docusign may provide translations of these Terms or other terms or policies. Translations are provided for informational purposes and if there is an inconsistency or conflict between a translation and the English version, the English version will control, unless prohibited by applicable law.</p><p><b>10.11. Waiver.</b> The waiver by either you or Docusign of any breach of any provision of these Terms does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to these Terms to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with these Terms will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of these Terms.</p><p><b>10.12. Severability.</b> If any part of these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, it will be deemed severed and the remaining portions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the grant of any license to you under these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the license will immediately terminate.</p><p><b>10.13.

In these cases, Docusign will inform you of the consequences of a silence.</p><p>A Fictitious Acceptance does not apply to changes in price, changes to main performance obligations, changes which would amount to the conclusion of a new contract, and which significantly shift the previously agreed contractual relationship between you and Docusign in Docusign’s favour.
