Service Plans, Renewal, Cancellation and Refund</strong></p><p></p><p style="text-align:start;"><strong>Service Plans</strong><br/>Some of the Services are provided to you free-of-charge (&quot;<strong>Free Services</strong>&quot;) while other Services require payment before you can use them, including but not limited to CapCut Pro and related Services (&quot;<strong>Premium Services</strong>&quot; or, collectively with Free Services, &quot;<strong>Service Plans</strong>&quot;). Whether you use Free Services or purchase or subscribe to Premium Services, you must always use those Service Plans in accordance with these Terms and applicable laws, as well as all additional rules, guidelines, and requirements applicable to such Service Plans.<br/>For more details of the Premium Services which we will provide you with, please refer to the detailed service descriptions on the purchase page of the relevant Premium Services on the Platform. Unless it is otherwise mandated by applicable laws of your jurisdiction, we reserve the right to change our Service Plans including, by adjusting the features or services available or by adjusting pricing for the Premium Services in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion, which will not, without cause, affect the Services and rights you have purchased and acquired under these Terms before such changes take effect. We may develop different versions of this Platform with different Services for different terminal devices in different regions, and you should obtain, download and install the appropriate version for your device and jurisdiction.<br/>If you purchase or subscribe to any of our Premium Services, you must first create an account on the Platform and login to the Platform. The Premium Services are only available to users of (i) the Apple iOS version of the Platform who have a valid Apple ID account, (ii) the Google Android OS version of the Platform who have a valid Google account or (iii) the CapCut Web version of the Platform who have a valid CapCut account.<br/>You may purchase or subscribe to any of our Premium Services by paying via your Apple ID, Google account and/or CapCut account (as applicable), by paying the applicable purchase or subscription fees and taxes in the applicable currency of your jurisdiction. Unless you are a resident within the UK, EU or EEA or it is otherwise mandated by applicable laws of your jurisdiction, all Premium Services fees displayed to you are exclusive of taxes, and you agree that you may be charged with any applicable taxes in addition to the Premium Services fees. Failure to pay these fees and taxes will result in the failure, suspension or termination of your access to the Premium Services.<br/>You may purchase or subscribe to the Premium Services under a fixed billing period or an automatic renewal subscription fee in advance on a monthly basis or another interval set on the purchase page of the relevant Premium Services on the Platform or otherwise notified to you prior to your subscription or in accordance with other payment arrangement available.<br/>If you purchase the Premium Services under an automatic renewal arrangement, you agree that (a) Apple, Google and/or CapCut (as applicable) may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) to avoid interruption of the Premium Services, and (b) Apple, Google and/or CapCut (as applicable) may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide at the time of purchase. Unless it is otherwise mandated by applicable laws of your jurisdiction, we reserve the right to change our Services Plans or adjust pricing for the Premium Services in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion and will communicate any such changes to you in advance. Such changes will not, without cause, affect the Services and rights you have already purchased and acquired under these Terms prior to such changes taking effect. Such changes will not take effect immediately at the time of renewal of your subscription, unless you explicitly agree otherwise. In particular, price changes will not take effect immediately at the start of the subsequent subscription period following the date of the price change. You always have the right to terminate your subscription to the Premium Services at any time and voluntarily choose a different Service Plan. As such, please make sure you read any notification of Service Plan changes carefully.<br/>You can find information about the pricing of the Premium Services either on the purchase page of our Premium Services or the Platformâs description page in Apple App Store and/or Google Play (as applicable). All subscriptions on the CapCut APP version are payable through your Apple ID and/or Google account and such payments will be processed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Apple App Store and/or Google Play. Subscriptions on CapCut Web are payable through your CapCut account and such payments will be processed in accordance with these Terms, the terms and conditions of third-party payment service providers and/or additional payment terms.</p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"><br/><strong>Renewal and Cancellation</strong><br/>If you subscribe to the Premium Services under an automatic renewable arrangement, your subscription fee will automatically renew for an additional period equal in duration to your preceding subscription term, unless indicated otherwise on the Platform, and your payment will automatically be charged at the start of each new subscription period for the fees applicable to that period, unless you cancel or change your subscription of the Premium Services before the end of the then-current subscription period applicable to you.<br/>If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring basis, you must cancel your subscription to the Premium Services through your Apple ID, Google account and/or CapCut account (as applicable) before the end of the then-current subscription period. You can learn more about how to cancel your subscription of our Services in the <em>FAQ</em>. If so cancelled, you will still have access to the Premium Services until the end of the then-current subscription period and be charged the full subscription fee for such subscription period unless otherwise set forth in the &quot;<em>Supplemental Terms â Jurisdiction-Specific</em>&quot; section below or required by applicable law, e.g. if you cancel the subscription for cause. After the cancellation takes effect on the last day of the then-current subscription period, you will be downgraded to the Free Services.<br/>You may choose the Premium Services you would like to purchase or subscribe to (including without limitation the term and the price of the applicable Premium Service you prefer). After the expiration of the term, the corresponding Premium Services will no longer be provided to you.</p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"><br/><strong>Refund policy</strong><br/>Unless otherwise set forth in the &quot;<em><span style="color:#245bdb"><a href="https://sf21-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/capcut/via_clause_user_agreement_en.html#Supplemental%20Terms%20%E2%80%93%20Jurisdiction%20Specific" data-href="https://sf21-draftcdn-sg.ibytedtos.com/obj/ies-hotsoon-draft-sg/capcut/via_clause_user_agreement_en.html#Supplemental%20Terms%20%E2%80%93%20Jurisdiction%20Specific" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supplemental Terms â Jurisdiction-Specific</a></span></em>&quot; section below, if you subscribe the Premium Services (with or without automatic renewal agreement), you may, with or without reason, cancel your subscription of the Premium Services with a full refund within 14 calendar days following the start of your subscription to the Premium Services, provided that you do not have any usage of the Premium Services in any form whatsoever since you subscribe to the Premium Services. If you believe you are entitled to receive a refund, please contact us. You may find more information about how to contact us in the <em>FAQ.</em> Any refund of subscription fees will be made with the same payment method you used for payment of the subscription fees. You agree to comply with this refund policy, our procedure in the <em>FAQ</em>, and any of our further communication with you, if any.<br/>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you subscribe the Premium Services through Apple Pay or Google Pay, your cancellation and refund is subject to the terms and conditions of Apple App Store or Google Play. You will continue to have access to the Premium Services until your subscription payment is refunded by Apple or Google.<br/>The above does not exclude or limit your right to refund, in full or in part, if the applicable laws require us to make such a refund to you.<br/></p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"></p><p style="text-align:start;"><strong>8. Cloud Space Services</strong></p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"></p><p>You may access limited cloud storage space provided by us on a free-of-charge basis; and you may also access more cloud storage space by subscribing to the relevant Premium Services, if such Premium Services are made available to you. Depending on the relevant Service Plan applicable to you (including without limitation the Premium Services to which you subscribe), the storage capacity of the cloud space allocated to you may differ. The allocated storage capacity applicable to the Premium Services you purchase will be displayed to you on the relevant Premium Services description page or when you make the purchase. You shall not use storage capacity exceeding the allocated storage capacity.<br/>Following the termination or expiration of your then current subscription term, if you choose not to renew your subscription, you will no longer have cloud space storage capacity, or, if we provide users with certain cloud space storage capacity for free, you will be downgraded to such free storage capacity. If you choose to downgrade your Premium Services, you will be downgraded to the storage capacity applicable to the Premium Service you select. For the avoidance of doubt, you acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to provide or continue to provide any user with a cloud space storage capacity plan for free.<br/>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance if the cloud space storage capacity applicable to you will be degraded or become unavailable. Within the time limit that we notify you of in advance, you should transfer and back up your content (including but not limited to your video drafts, photos, stickers and other materials) stored in the cloud space provided by the Platform before the expiration of such Service Plan, and ensure that, in case your storage capacity is downgraded, the content you store does not exceed the storage capacity that you are entitled to use, so as to avoid the loss of your content and data due to the absence of sufficient cloud space storage capacity.<br/>In addition to these Terms, you shall comply with the applicable requirements and restrictions applicable to the cloud space storage services (e.g., file type restriction, format restriction, document size limit). If your use violates these Terms, applicable laws or any applicable rule, we have the right to take corresponding measures, such as suspending or terminating your access to the corresponding Services, deleting your content which exceeds your entitled storage capacity or that fails to comply with these Terms, applicable laws, or rules applicable to such cloud space storage feature.<br/>You shall always back up your content. We are not liable for any loss of your content or data stored by using the cloud space storage feature to the extent permitted by applicable laws.<br/></p><p style="text-align:start;"><strong>9. Unlockable Templates</strong></p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"></p><p>Certain templates may be made available to help users to create videos more easily. Users can create a video by replacing certain images, photos or videos of such templates. But the elements of the templates that can be modified are limited if users use Free Services.<br/>We now make available a Premium Service where Users will be able to edit more elements of the templates (&quot;<strong>Unlockable Templates</strong>&quot;) through the premium editing function on the Platform of which the intellectual property right is owned by us. As mentioned above, our Services may not be available in all jurisdiction for all devices in all languages. Thus the Premium Service for the Unlockable Template may not be made available to you.<br/>If you subscribe to such Premium Service for our right-owned premium editing function to unlock templates, you have a limited right to use such premium editing function and edit the Unlockable Template during the applicable subscription term, provided that (a) the specific premium editing function and the specific Unlockable Template available to you may differ depending on your jurisdiction, device, language setting, etc. and (b) the specific elements of each Unlockable Template that can be edited may differ on a case-by-case basis, subject to the actual elements of such Unlockable Template made available for editing in practice on the Services, which may vary and be updated from time to time. Unlockable Templates edited by you will not be allowed to be posted as new templates on the Platform. Neither can you share or distribute Unlockable Templates you edited with other users nor otherwise permit others to use such Unlockable Templates you edited.<br/>Such Unlockable Templates are provided by third-party creators (â<strong>Creators</strong>â) rather than us. That is, such Unlockable Templates are not Companyâs Content. We make no conditions, endorsement, representations or warranties with respect to any and all Unlockable Templates and elements and content therein.<br/>No additional right or license of Companyâs Content is granted, licensed or otherwise transferred to you arising from or in connection with your subscription to the Premium Service for our right-owned premium editing function to unlock templates or use of the Unlockable Templates. All rights to the Companyâs Content granted to you are those expressly set forth in Section 12 below.</p><p style="text-align:start;text-indent:2em;"></p><p style="text-align:start;"><strong>10.
