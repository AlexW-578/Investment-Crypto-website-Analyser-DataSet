EXCLUDING DISPUTES ADDRESSED THROUGH ARBITRATION AS PROVIDED BELOW, YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMPETENT STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA IN RELATION TO ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THE TERMS OR SERVICES, AND YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT OF REMOVAL OR TRANSFER WHETHER DUE TO FORUM NON CONVENIENS OR OTHER REASON. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are expressly excluded from these Terms.</div><div class="text-block-239"><strong>11.2. Dispute Resolution<br/></strong>We are available by email at <a href="mailto:LegalDepartment@dcsg.com">LegalDepartment@dcsg.com</a> to address any legal concerns you may have regarding the Terms or the Services. Most such concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Any matter or dispute relating in any way to the Terms or the Services which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided herein.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the binding arbitration herein, either party to a dispute may litigate in court as provided herein to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator, and to the extent that you violate or threaten to violate our intellectual property or confidentiality rights, we may seek non-monetary injunctive or other equitable relief relating thereto.<br/><br/>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</div><div class="text-block-239"><strong>11.3. Arbitration<br/></strong>If the parties donât reach an agreed-upon resolution as provided in the section above, you and we each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Terms or the Services, or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator. The arbitrator will be mutually selected by the parties in dispute. The arbitrator must be a retired federal or state judge who worked as a judge in the state where the arbitration will take place, and must also be experienced with the subject matter of the arbitration. If, after sixty (60) days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either party may petition a court with proper jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator: (a) pursuant to a process whereby the court provides the parties with a panel of five potential arbitrators meeting the requirements herein for an arbitrator, each party strikes one arbitrator, and the court appoints the arbitrator from the remaining arbitrators on the panel based on the arbitratorâs qualifications and expertise, and the requirements herein; or (b) pursuant to the arbitrator selection process provided in the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. For purposes of this Section, good faith meet and confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described herein. The selected or appointed arbitrator must hear the matter on consecutive business days without interruption, except in the event of a bifurcation or agreement of the parties. The arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMSâ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. We strive to offer a fundamentally-fair arbitration hearing process. For small claims (i.e., up to $10,000), in addition to your right to bring small claims court actions as noted below, we believe this can often be satisfied when hearings are conducted via electronic or telephonic means or by a submission of documents in lieu of a personal appearance by the parties. However the arbitrator shall have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such face to face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing. Notwithstanding our right to modify the Terms, any such modification to the dispute and/or arbitration requirements in this Section shall not apply to claims arising prior to the date of such modification and any such changes shall not affect your prior election to opt out of arbitration as provided below. In connection with these arbitration provisions, the parties agree as follows: (1) This arbitration agreement is reciprocally binding on all parties such that both you and we are required to arbitrate claims except as expressly provided herein; (2) Remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties under applicable federal, state or local laws, including without limitation the recovery of attorneyâs fees, remain available under this arbitration clause; (3) The arbitrator must be neutral and the parties will each have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator; (4) You have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area within the United States; (5) You have the right to use counsel of your choosing at your own expense if you so elect to use counsel, and to recover attorneysâ fees and expenses of arbitration to the extent provided by law; (6) The parties are permitted the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures; and (7) The arbitratorâs award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</div><div class="text-block-239"><strong>11.4. Arbitration Filing Fees<br/></strong>If you initiate the arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the lesser of $250 or the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost. All other costs of the arbitration will be borne by us. You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses unless the arbitration rules or applicable law permit you to recover your attorneyâs fees. You will not be required to pay any fees or costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that the claim was brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award us our attorneyâs fees, expert witness fees, arbitration-related fees and/or costs. If we are the claiming party initiating an arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneysâ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law).</div><div class="text-block-239"><strong>11.5. Waiver of Certain Rights from Court<br/></strong>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court. Court proceedings generally provide greater discovery rights, a judge or jury trial, and could provide greater opportunity for appellate review. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.</div><div class="text-block-239"><strong>11.6. Class Action Waiver<br/></strong>THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION (OR LITIGATION, WHERE PERMITTED HEREUNDER) SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THE TERMS, YOU INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, YOU AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS CONSTITUTES CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH WAIVER. THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CAN NOT BE SEVERED FROM THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.<br/><br/>EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE THAT EACH PARTY TO A DISPUTE HEREUNDER MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

By registering for an account or placing an order, you represent that the products or services ordered will be used only in a lawful manner and as intended by such manufacturer. The Sites are not intended to subject DICK&#x27;S to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory other than that of the United States, and We do not represent or warrant that the Sites or any part thereof is appropriate or available for use in any jurisdiction besides the United States. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and/or sale of any product or service purchased via a Site.<br/><br/>10. Shipping Charges and Limitations. When a product order is placed for delivery, it will be shipped to the address designated by the purchaser, as long as such shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Site. All deliveries of product purchases from a Site are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for products purchased from a Site pass to you upon delivery to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments. Shipping charges may exceed actual shipping costs. Some items ordered from a Site may be available for pick up in a store of your choice. If an item is available for pick up, you will be presented with the option to do so when selecting your item for purchase. After placing your order, we will send you an email or text message (if elected) with your estimated pick up time. Please consult your order time confirmation email or text for your specific estimated pick up time. All pick up times are estimates. While we strive to meet specified pick up times as quoted, DICKâS does not make any guarantee that your order will be available at any specific time. DICKâS will not have any liability for any order delays.<br/><br/>11. Confirmation, Cancellation and Coupons. While it is our practice to confirm online orders via email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order nor our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice and at any time: (a) to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service or fulfillment of any order or to any customer; (b) to discontinue any product or service; (c) to bar any user from making or completing a transaction; and (d) to limit or impose conditions on the honoring of any coupon, coupon code, promotional code, or other similar promotion.<br/>â<br/>For clarification, orders may be limited or cancelled at any time including after receipt of a confirmation or shipping email. We also may require additional information and/or verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.<br/><br/>For products purchased from our Sites using a credit card, an authorization may be placed on your credit card when you place an order. You will be charged for an item (and your purchase of such item will be complete) when the item in your order is shipped or picked up in the store, as applicable. Certain custom items may be charged when the order is placed. Partial shipment or partial cancellation of orders may occur.<br/>â<br/>For products purchased from our Sites using a gift card, the full amount of the purchase price will be applied to your gift card when you place the order. However your purchase of such item is not complete until the item in your order is shipped or picked up in the store, as applicable. Partial shipment or partial cancellation of orders may occur. If an order for an item purchased with a gift card is cancelled, the amount applicable to the cancelled item will be restored to your gift card or you will be issued a new gift card for such amount. <br/><br/>Taxes that appear in your online order confirmation are estimated. Because orders may be fulfilled from multiple locations across the U.S., the actual taxes charged to your credit card will be calculated based on the applicable state and local sales taxes when your order is shipped. A minor post-charge adjustment may be made to your credit card account to ensure that we collect the correct amount of actual taxes. <br/><br/>12. Intellectual Property.

Counter-Notice.

Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in ten (10) to fourteen (14) business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at DICK&#x27;S sole discretion.<br/><br/>21. Disputes, Choice of Law, and Jurisdiction.<br/><br/>(a) Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at <a href="mailto:LegalDepartement@dcsg.com" target=""><strong>LegalDepartment@dcsg.com</strong></a> to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Sites. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Any matter and/or dispute relating in any way to your visit to or interaction with a Site, including compliance with these Terms, which is not so resolved shall be submitted to binding confidential arbitration as provided in Section 22 (herein).<br/><br/>(b) Choice of Law and Courts for Non-Arbitrated Disputes. Unless expressly addressed in the Additional Terms, these Terms supersede any other agreement between you and DICK&#x27;S to the extent necessary to resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity between them. The Sites are administered by DICK&#x27;S from its offices in Pennsylvania. Notwithstanding the arbitration provisions in Section 22, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, We may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in the state courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, and you consent to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in such courts.<br/><br/>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.<strong> <br/><br/>â</strong>22. Arbitration.<br/><br/>(a) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â If the parties donât reach an agreed upon solution pursuant to the dispute-resolution contemplated in Section 21(a) of these Terms, you and DICKâs each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to our products or services or the Sites (including, without limitation, DICK&#x27;S digital operations at or through our websites, our mobile/tablet sites, our social media presence, our Scorecard program, our applications, and our stores/locations for each member of our Family of Businesses), or these Terms or the breach, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, shall be determined by binding arbitration before one arbitrator. The arbitrator will be mutually selected by the Parties. The arbitrator must be a retired federal or state judge who worked as a judge in the state where the arbitration will take place, and must also be experienced with the subject matter of the arbitration. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition a court with proper jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator: (a) pursuant to a process whereby the court provides the Parties with a panel of five potential arbitrators meeting the requirements herein for an arbitrator, each Party strikes one arbitrator, and the court appoints the arbitrator from the remaining arbitrators on the panel based on the arbitratorâs qualifications and expertise, and the requirements of this Agreement; or (b) pursuant to the arbitrator selection process provided in the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. For purposes of this Section, good faith meet and confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in this Agreement. The selected or appointed arbitrator must hear the matter on consecutive business days without interruption, except in the event of a bifurcation or agreement of the Parties. The arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS&#x27; Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes. We strive to offer a fundamentally-fair arbitration hearing process. For small claims (i.e., up to $10,000), in addition to your right to bring small claims court actions as noted below, We believe this can often be satisfied when hearings are conducted via electronic or telephonic means or by a submission of documents in lieu of a personal appearance by the parties. However the arbitrator shall have discretionary authority to require a face-to-face meeting, if it determines that such face to face meeting is necessary for a fundamentally fair hearing. Notwithstanding DICKâS right to modify these Terms, DICKâS agrees that it will post any changes to these terms at least thirty (30) days in advance of its effective date. Further, any such modification to the dispute and/or arbitration requirements in Section 21 or to this Section 22 shall not apply to claims arising prior to the date of such modification and any such changes shall not affect your prior election to opt out of arbitration as provided below. In connection with these arbitration provisions, the parties agree as follows:<br/><br/>1. This arbitration agreement is reciprocally binding on all parties such that both you and We are required to arbitrate claims;<br/>2. Remedies that would otherwise be available to the parties under applicable federal, state or local laws, including the recovery of attorneyâs fees, remain available under this arbitration clause;<br/>3. The arbitrator must be neutral and the parties will each have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the process of choosing the arbitrator;<br/>4. You have a right to an in-person hearing in your hometown area within the United States;<br/>5. You have the right to the use of counsel of your choosing at your own expense if you so elect to use counsel, and to recover attorneysâ fees and expenses of arbitration to the extent provided by law;<br/>6. The parties are permitted the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute in accordance with JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures; and<br/>7. The arbitrator&#x27;s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.<br/><br/>(b) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Arbitration Filing Fees. If you initiate the arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the lesser of $250 or the cost of filing a lawsuit, DICKâS will pay the additional cost. All other costs of the arbitration will be borne by Us. You will be responsible for your own attorney fees and expenses unless the arbitration rules or applicable law permit you to recover your attorneyâs fees. You will not be required to pay any fees or costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that the claim was brought in bad faith, in which case the arbitrator may award us our attorneyâs fees, expert witness fees, arbitration-related fees and/or costs. If we are the claiming party initiating an arbitration against you, We will pay all costs associated with the arbitration (other than your attorneysâ fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law).<br/><br/>(c) Waiver of Certain Rights from Court. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court. Court proceedings generally provide greater discovery rights, a judge or jury trial, and could provide greater opportunity for appellate review. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation.<br/><br/>(d) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â <strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO FILE A CLASS ACTION OR SEEK RELIEF ON A CLASS BASIS <br/><br/>(e) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Exception - Small Claims Court Claims. Notwithstanding the parties&#x27; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court&#x27;s jurisdiction. Any appeal of the decision in such small claims court shall be subject to these arbitration provisions.<br/><br/>(f) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 30-Day Right to Opt-Out.<strong> </strong>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in this Section 22 by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address via certified mail: Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods, Inc., 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, PA 15108, Attention: Legal Department. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of a Site after the effective date of these Terms, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those Sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, DICKâS also will not be bound by them.<br/><br/>(g) Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, IN PARTICULAR THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST DICKâS ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION OR OTHER ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU INTEND TO BE LEGALLY BOUND AND, IN ADDITION TO OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, YOU AGREE THAT DICKâS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE CLAIMS CONSTITUTES CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH WAIVER. THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND CAN NOT BE SEVERED FROM THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES.<br/><br/>23. Admissibility. A printed version of these Terms shall be admissible in judicial and administrative proceedings and in arbitration proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.<br/><br/>24. Waiver and Severability. No waiver by either party of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of a party to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br/><br/>25. Entire Agreement. These Terms and our Privacy Policy and Additional Terms constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and DICK&#x27;S with respect to the Sites and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Site.<br/><br/>26. Termination. You or DICK&#x27;S may suspend or terminate your account or your use/access of a Site at any time, for any reason or for no reason. You are personally liable for any activity prior to such termination, including any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. DICK&#x27;S reserves the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any aspect of the Sites at any time without notice except as provided in these Terms.<br/><br/>27. Additional Assistance.
