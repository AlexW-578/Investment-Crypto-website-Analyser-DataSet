        <h1>Terms of Service/Service Agreement</h1>
    </header>
    <section class="main-content">
        <p>Effective Date: October 2024</p>
        <p>This Agreement is made by and between Securly, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“Company” or
            “Securly”), a Delaware corporation with offices at 322 Lamar Ave, Suite 107 #1046, Charlotte, NC 28204, and its customer (“Customer”) listed on one or more order forms (each, an “Order”)
            executed by and between the parties (collectively, the “Agreement”).</p>
        <p>Company will provide to Customer the cloud-based software products and services identified in the Order
            (collectively, the “Services” and, each, a “Service”). The Services may include, without limitation:
            Company’s
            cloud-based web filtering; online activity monitoring for cyberbullying; hall pass, visitor, and flex time
            management; auditing software; mobile device management software, tablet, and other computer assets;
            location
            tracking software, device control software for teacher classroom management, and any other software or
            services
            offered by Company, including all updates thereto and related documentation. Company shall provide all
            necessary
            user identifications and passwords for the Services for use by Customer’s employees, agents, independent
            contractors, students and parents/guardians, in each case as authorized by Customer to access the Services
            (“Users”).</p>
        <p>In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and one or more written agreements signed by
            the parties setting forth the Customer’s requirements (collectively, the “Customer Terms”), the conflicting
            provision in the Customer Terms shall take precedence.</p>
        <h2>1. Support</h2>
        <p>Company shall provide Customer with support services as specified in the Order (the “Support Services”).</p>
        <h2>2. Ownership and Licenses</h2>
        <p>(a) Ownership of the Service; Intellectual Property. Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and
            all proprietary rights (including, but not limited to, all copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret
            rights) in and to the Services (including all software used to provide the Services and all portions thereof
            and all derivatives or improvements thereof and all related documentation), whether or not incorporated into
            or used with other software as a service, software or hardware. Customer’s use of the Services does not
            constitute a sale of any of such software or any portion thereof. Company’s name, logo, and the product
            names associated with the Services are trademarks of Company or third parties, and no right or license is
            granted herein to use them. Company hereby grants Customer, solely during the term of this Agreement, a
            limited, royalty-free, revocable license to use and install the Company provided software (which may include
            certificates and pack files) solely on Customer’s machines and devices and only as necessary or appropriate
            to receive the Services (the “Client Software”) and in accordance with the limitations (if any) set forth in
            the Order, and to use and reproduce a reasonable number of copies of any documentation solely to support
            Customer’s use of the Services.</p>
        <p>(b) Ownership of User Data. The Services may allow Customer to track and gather a range of data and
            information regarding its Users including, without limitation, information about students enrolled at
            Customer’s educational institution, including the student's name, the student's (or student's family's)
            address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, place of birth, mother's maiden name, grades,
            social security number (or other governmental identification number), biometric information, and other
            information that alone or in combination would reasonably allow a person or entity to identify the student
            with reasonable certainty (collectively, “User Data”). Customer shall retain all title to and ownership of
            and all proprietary rights with respect to User Data, and shall be solely responsible for its use thereof.
            Customer is also responsible for securing and backing up its User Data and Company shall only restore lost
            User Data to its last-backup point if the loss was due to a fault in Company’s Services or Support Services.
            Customer hereby grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to access and use User
            Data for the sole purpose of enabling Company to provide the Services, and for the limited purposes set
            forth in Company’s Privacy Policy (described below). Customer also grants Company a worldwide, royalty-free,
            and non-exclusive license Customer’s trademarks, service marks, and logos as required to provide the
            Services.</p>
        <p>(c) Data Use. To the extent Company receives any personal information (as such term or any analogous term may
            be as defined under applicable law) from or on behalf of Customer in connection with Company’s provision of
            Services to Customer under the Agreement (“Customer Personal Information”), Company will only use, retain,
            disclose and otherwise process such Customer Personal Information for the purpose of providing the Services
            or in order to comply with the law. Any such use, retention, disclosure, and processing will comply with all
            applicable state and federal laws, including, without limitation, the Family Education Rights and Privacy
            Act ("FERPA"). Company may disclose Customer Personal Information to its service providers as necessary for
            Company to provide the services to Customer, provided such disclosure shall be consistent with all
            applicable state and federal laws. Company will however not otherwise retain, use, or disclose Customer
            Personal Information for any purpose other than to perform the Services or outside of the direct business
            relationship between Customer and Company. Specifically, it will not sell, rent, release, disclose,
            disseminate, make available, transfer or otherwise communicate Customer Personal Information to any third
            party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Unless Customer has specified in writing a specific
            retention period for Customer Personal Information, Company will securely destroy such data when it is no
            longer needed to provide the services, in accordance with Company’s standard data retention and destruction
            policies.</p>
        <p>(d) Data sources. Customer acknowledges that, depending on the type of Services Company provides to Customer,
            Company may rely on publicly available or third-party data in order to provide the Services. Customer
            understands and agrees that Company has no responsibility for the accuracy, availability, reliability, or
            integrity of such data. Customer shall have the sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity,
            legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all User Data and shall maintain the minimum hardware,
            software, and connectivity configuration specified from time to time by Company as required for use of the
            Services (the “Supported Environment”) (if any) described in the Order.
        <p>(e) Ownership of Reports and Analyses. Company may provide Customer with certain reports and analyses as part
            of the Services (“Reports”). Company shall retain all title to and ownership of and all proprietary rights
            with respect to such Reports, excluding Customer’s Confidential Information as defined in Section 5 below.
            Company hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, and non-transferable license, for the
            term of this Agreement, to use Reports strictly for Customer’s own internal, legitimate, non-commercial,
            educational purposes.</p>
        <p>(f) Mobile App and Parent/Guardian Usage. Customer acknowledges that Users may need to download the Company’s
            mobile application from the relevant major mobile device provider app stores (Apple’s App Store or Google
            Play) and that use of the Company’s mobile application or website by parents/guardians is subject to
            Company’s terms of service and Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>(g) Feedback. If Customer provides any ideas, suggestions or recommendations to Company regarding Company’s
            software, products, services or technology (“Feedback”), such Feedback is provided on a non-confidential
            basis to Company and Company is free to retain, disclose, use and incorporate such Feedback in Company’s
            and/or its affiliates' products and services, without payment of royalties or other consideration to
            Customer. Customer understands and agrees that Company is not obligated to use, display, reproduce, or
            distribute any such Feedback, and that it has no right to compel such use, display, reproduction, or
            distribution. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation on Customer to provide Feedback
            to Company.</p>
        <p>(h) Certain items of software used in the Services are subject to "open source" or "free software" licenses
            ("Open Source Software"). Some of the Open Source Software is owned by third parties. The Open Source
            Software is not subject to the terms and conditions of Sections 2(a) or 4(a). Instead, each item of Open
            Source Software is licensed under the terms of the end-user license that accompanies such Open Source
            Software. Nothing in this Agreement limits Customer’s rights under, or grants Customer rights that
            supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable end user license for the Open Source Software. If
            required by any license for particular Open Source Software, Company makes such Open Source Software, and
            Company modifications to that Open Source Software, available by written request at the notice address
            specified on the Order Form.</p>
        <h2>3. Privacy and Security</h2>
        <p>(a) Company maintains appropriate administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect User
            Data to the extent reasonably necessary for the performance of the Services consistent with all applicable
            state and federal laws and regulations. In the event Company becomes aware of a breach or suspected breach
            of any privacy or security measures that compromises the confidentiality or integrity of data that is linked
            to or can be linked to an identifiable individual (“Personal Data”), Company will promptly notify Customer
            thereof, and use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy such breach.</p>
        <p>(b) The parties agree that Customer is an educational institution, that Company is a service provider to
            Customer, and that Company’s collection and use of the personally identifiable User Data of children under
            the age of 18 (“Minor User Data”) is conducted on behalf of and with the authorization of Customer, in order
            to provide the Services requested by Customer. Customer has received and reviewed Company’s Privacy Policy,
            which includes a privacy policy and direct notice of privacy practices as required by the Children’s Online
            Privacy Protection Act Rule, 16 C.F.R. 313 (“COPPA”). Customer expressly consents to the collection, use and
            disclosure of Minor User Data as set forth in the Privacy Policy as applicable to those Services requested
            by Company. For the purposes of COPPA, Customer acknowledges that it is an educational institution, that it
            plans to use the Services in its capacity as an educational institution, and that it is authorized to
            consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Minor User Data by Company in order to provide the
            Services. Customer further acknowledges, and Company agrees to provide, Customer an opportunity to review
            the Minor User Data, and to request that such data be corrected (to the extent practicable), deleted, and/or
            no longer collected or used (which may impact the availability of the Services). By using the Services,
            Customer expressly acknowledges that it has received and reviewed the Privacy Policy, and grants its consent
            to Company’s collection, use and disclosure of Minor User Data in accordance with the Privacy Policy,
            which may be updated from time to time, provided Customer will be notified of any material changes. The
            Parties further agree that Company is a “school official” with a legitimate educational interest in
            receiving Personal Information about students. For the purposes of FERPA, Company agrees that it will comply
            with the requirements of 34 C.F.R. § 99.33 regarding its use and redisclosure of Educational Information (as
            defined in FERPA). Customer agrees and consents to the Company’s use of such information so long as such use
            complies with FERPA. Customer acknowledges that it is responsible for notifying the Company that a student
            or parent objects to Company’s use of Minor User Data in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
        <p>(c) Notwithstanding Section 2(b), Customer expressly agrees that Company may aggregate or de-identify User
            Data, including Minor User Data, such that it no longer is liked or reasonably linkable to an identifiable
            individual (“De-Identified/Aggregated Data”), and may maintain and use such data for its own purposes as set
            forth in the Privacy Policy, provided it has implemented reasonable safeguards to prevent the
            re-identification of Aggregate Data.</p>
        <p>(d) Customer agrees that Company may transfer User Data to its successor pursuant to a merger, consolidation
            or sale of substantially all of its assets pursuant to Section 15 of this Agreement and its successor may
            use, disclose, re-identify, store, or delete such data to the same extent that Company may do so pursuant to
            this Agreement.</p>
        <h2>4. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>(a) Customer agrees that it shall not, nor permit any User or other party to, do any of the following: (i)
            modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile, or reverse engineer any part of the Services
            (including any Client Software), or in any way attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code or
            underlying ideas or algorithms of any part of the Services (including any Client Software); (ii) access or
            use the Services (including any Client Software) in order to build a similar or competitive product or
            service or for the purposes of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Company; (iii)
            except as otherwise expressly provided herein, copy, reproduce, distribute, republish, download, display,
            post or transmit in any form or by any means any of the Services (including any Client Software or any
            related documentation); (iv) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services and Customer shall make
            commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized third parties from accessing the Services (including
            any Client Software); or (v) exceed the permitted number of devices, active users or students, teachers,
            faculty and staff in a school or district, in each case as specified in an Order.</p>
        <p>(b) Customer agrees that it shall not, nor permit any User or other party to (i) access or attempt to access
            the administrative interface of the Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided
            by Company in connection with the Services, unless otherwise agreed in writing or (ii) intentionally engage
            in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or any servers or networks that are connected
            to the Services).</p>
        <p>(c) Customer agrees that it is responsible for all activity occurring under Customers’ accounts for the
            Services by its authorized users. Customer shall notify Company within a commercially reasonable time of any
            unauthorized use of any user account or any unauthorized use of the Services. Customer may not access the
            Company Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring fees or provide incorrect information for an Order
            for purposes of reducing amounts payable to Company. User IDs cannot be shared or used by more than one User
            at a time.</p>
        <p>(d) If any software or documentation is acquired by or on behalf of a unit or agency of the United States
            Government, Customer agrees that such software or documentation is “commercial computer software” or
            “commercial computer software documentation” and that, absent a written agreement with Company to the
            contrary, Customer’s rights with respect to such software and documentation are, in the case of civilian
            agency use, Restricted Rights (as defined in FAR §52.227.19), and, if for DoD use, limited by the terms of
            this Agreement, pursuant to DFARS §227.7202.</p>
        <p>(e) Where Customer’s use of the Services include visitor management, verification and tracking of visitors
            and other individuals, and related services or applications (“VMS”): agrees that: (i) it is responsible for
            ensuring that its collection, use and disclosure of all
            information (including personal information) and its instructions to Securly comply with applicable laws;
            (ii) it has provided (and will continue to provide) adequate notices and has obtained (and will continue to
            obtain) the necessary permissions and consents from each relevant individual to the collection, use,
            disclosure and/or storage of their information; (iii) it will not use the VMS (or any other of the Services)
            for the purposes of obtaining or conducting, background checks, employment verification, hiring, promotion,
            retention, termination, or reassignment decisions including but not limited to with respect to vendors,
            employees, contractors, providers, volunteers or other personnel; or otherwise engaging in any activities
            that are regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (as amended) and the regulations, guidance, and orders
            promulgated thereto (“FCRA”) or other state or federal laws or regulations related to consumer credit
            reports and background checks.</p>
        <h2>5. Confidential Information</h2>
        <p>(a) “Confidential Information” means any and all non-public information provided or revealed by one party
            (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”) or otherwise learned by a party during the course of
            performance under this Agreement, including without limit software, programs, prices, processes,
            documentation, financial, marketing and other business information, and all other material or information
            that is identified at the time of disclosure as confidential or proprietary or which otherwise would
            reasonably be expected to be kept confidential. Confidential Information shall also include: (i) the
            Discloser’s planned or existing computer systems and systems architecture, including computer hardware,
            computer software, source code, object code, documentation, methods of processing and operational methods;
            (ii) the Discloser’s customer lists, sales, profits, organizational structure and restructuring, new
            business initiatives and finances; (iii) the Discloser’s services and products, product designs, and how
            such products are administered and managed; and (iv) Customer’s User Data, including Minor User Data and
            Customer Personal Information. Recipient’s obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information
            that: (1) is or becomes public through no fault or breach by Recipient, (2) is or becomes known to Recipient
            (either directly or rightfully through a third party) without an obligation of confidentiality, or (3) is
            independently developed by Recipient without use of or access or reference to Discloser’s Confidential
            Information.</p>
        <p>(b) During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the termination or
            expiration of this Agreement, or with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade
            secret of the Discloser, for so long as such information constitutes a trade secret, Recipient shall hold
            Discloser’s Confidential Information in confidence and will not disseminate or disclose the Confidential
            Information to any third party except its Personnel, as set forth herein, unless required by applicable law
            to do so. Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care it uses
            to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event will Recipient use less
            than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient will use Discloser’s Confidential Information solely to the
            extent necessary to exercise its rights and obligations under this Agreement and will ensure that
            Confidential Information is disclosed only to its employees, contractors and other personnel (individually
            and collectively, “Personnel”) with a bona fide need to know and who are under binding written obligations
            of confidentiality with Recipient to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information substantially in
            accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any
            breach of this Section 5 by any Personnel. In addition, Recipient will implement and maintain appropriate
            technical and organizational measures to protect Confidential Information against accidental or unlawful
            destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and which provide a level of
            security appropriate to the
            risk represented by the processing and the nature of the Confidential Information to be protected. Recipient
            may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required to by the order or requirement of a
            court, administrative agency, or other governmental body; provided, however, that the Recipient notifies the
            Discloser in writing in advance of such disclosure (unless prohibited by law from doing so) and provides the
            Discloser with copies of any related information so that the Discloser may take appropriate action to
            protect its Confidential Information.</p>
        <p>(c) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of Discloser, and Recipient shall not
            acquire any rights or licenses therein except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Recipient shall
            return to Discloser (or at Discloser’s option, destroy) any and all Confidential Information and any other
            information and materials that contain such Confidential Information (including all copies in any form)
            immediately upon Discloser’s written request, when the Information is no longer required to provide the
            services, and upon the termination of this Agreement, in each case in accordance with Receiver’s written
            data retention and destruction policies. Within ten (10) days following Discloser’s written request,
            Recipient will provide Discloser with a written certification, as signed by an o9icer or executive level
            employee of Recipient, certifying compliance with this Section 5. For the avoidance of doubt, Recipient
            shall not be required to return or destroy Aggregate Data.</p>
        <p>(d) Recipient acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information in breach of the terms of this
            Section 5 may cause Discloser irreparable injury and damages that may be difficult to ascertain. Therefore,
            Discloser, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information by Recipient or any
            Personnel, will be entitled to injunctive relief (without being required to post bond), including, but not
            limited to, a preliminary injunction upon an ex parte application by the Discloser to protect and recover
            its Confidential Information, and the Recipient will not object to the entry of an injunction or other
            equitable relief against the Discloser on the basis of an adequate remedy at law, lack of irreparable harm
            or any other reason. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient will advise the Discloser immediately in
            the event that it learns or has reason to believe that any person or entity that has had access to
            Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, through the Receiver, has violated or intends to violate
            the terms of this Agreement. This provision will not in any way limit such other remedies as may be
            available to the Discloser, whether under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>
        <h2>6. Billing and Payment</h2>
        <p>(a) The amount of the recurring fees associated with the use of the Services and the Support Services by
            Customer shall be as set forth in the Order (the “Fees”). Fees for Services may be charged based on the
            number of (i) devices or active Users, (ii) the number
            of students in a school or district, or (iii) students, teachers, faculty and staff in a school or district,
            as specified in an Order. Additionally, there may be other basis for calculating the Fees, as specified in
            the Order. The Fees exclude all applicable sales, use, and other taxes, fees, duties and similar charges
            (“Taxes”), and Customer will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes (other than taxes based on
            Company’s income) and any penalties or charges that accrue with respect to the non-payment of any Taxes as
            well as government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees Company incurs collecting late
            amounts. All amounts payable under this Agreement will be payable in U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days of
            receipt of invoice, unless specified otherwise in the Order or Customer is purchasing the Services and
            Support Services through an authorized reseller and the parties have agreed that Customer is to pay the
            authorized reseller directly. Payment of fees shall be made by the Customer prior to receiving the Services.
            The payment may be made by check or wire transfer. Unless prohibited by applicable law, late payments may
            bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less). To the fullest
            extent permitted by law, Customer waives all (i) claims relating to charges unless claimed within sixty (60)
            days after invoicing, and (ii) refunds under any situations aside from those contemplated in this Agreement.
            Notwithstanding any fees for services posted on Company’s website or otherwise published by Company, the
            parties acknowledge and agree that the Fees may only be modified as set forth below in the “Modification;
            Waiver” section of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>(b) If Customer is purchasing the Services or Support Services (or both) through an authorized reseller,
            Customer shall pay the fees for the Services and Support Services, as applicable, on a timely basis directly
            to the authorized reseller. Without limiting Company’s remedies under this Agreement, at law or in equity,
            Company reserves the right to suspend provision of the Services or Support Services (or both) and to
            terminate this Agreement should Customer fail to pay the authorized reseller on time, regardless of the
            reason.</p>
        <h2>7. Term and Termination</h2>
        <p>(a) This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with this
            Agreement, shall remain in effect for the initial period specified in the Order (or, if no period is
            specified in the Order, then for an initial period of twelve (12) months) (the “Initial Term”). Unless
            otherwise specified in an agreement containing the Customer Terms, this Agreement will thereafter continue
            for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party
            written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. The Initial Term,
            together with all Renewal Terms, are collectively referred to as the “Term”. Unless a fixed term without
            renewals is specified in a Services Agreement, it is Customer’s responsibility
            to provide timely notice of non-renewal as required herein, and failure to do so will result in automatic
            renewal of the Agreement.</p>
        <p>(b) Either party may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the other party upon the occurrence
            of an Event of Default by the other party. For purposes of this Agreement, “Event of Default” means a breach
            by a party of any of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement, if such breach
            remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) days following receipt of written notice from the other party.
        </p>
        <p>(c) If Customer is a government entity, Customer may terminate this Agreement upon advance written notice
            provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term in the event that funds are not
            appropriated for any renewal year.</p>
        <p>(d) Customer may terminate this Agreement for convenience upon thirty (30) days advance written notice;
            provided, however, in the event of a termination for convenience Customer shall not be entitled to a pro
            rata refund of fees paid or reduction in fees owed for the then current term.</p>
        <p>(e) Any and all provisions in this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to be performed after the
            termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive and be enforceable after such termination or
            expiration, including without limitation provisions relating to confidentiality, ownership of materials,
            payment, taxes, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability, effects of
            termination, and governing law.</p>
        <p>(f) Immediately upon termination of this Agreement, (a) the licenses granted to either party shall
            immediately terminate; and (b) Company shall cease to make available and Customer shall cease to use the
            Services. Termination shall not relieve Customer’s obligation to pay all charges accrued before the
            effective date of termination.</p>
        <h2>8. Representations and Warranties</h2>
        <p>(a) Each party represents, covenants, and warrants to the other party that there is no applicable law,

            Agreement will be treated as “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation”

            have been avoided by the absence of the modifications, (c) use of any version other than a current release
            of the Service, if infringement would have been avoided by use of a current release, or (d) any action or

            publicly-available list of Company’s customers.</p>
        <h2>13. Relationship of the Parties</h2>

            or any association or joint venture between the parties. Neither party is, nor will hold itself out to be,
            an agent of the other party. Neither party is authorized to enter into any contractual commitment on behalf
            of the other party.</p>
        <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>Except for payment obligations already due and owing, any delay in or failure of performance by a party under
            this Agreement will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and will be excused to the extent caused by
            any occurrence beyond the reasonable control of such party, provided that the party affected by such event
            will immediately notify the other party and begin or resume performance as soon as practicable after the
            event has abated. If the act or condition beyond a party’s reasonable control that prevents such party from
            performing any of its obligations under this Agreement continues for thirty (30) days or more, then the
            other party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the non-performing party.
            Without limitation, act or condition beyond Company’s reasonable control include all acts and omissions of
            Company’s service providers. In the event of such termination by Customer, Company shall refund to Customer
            such fees for the terminated services that Customer pre-paid to Company for the period following the
            effective date of termination, and shall also exercise commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer
            with reasonable opportunity to access the Services for the purpose of retrieving User Data. In all other
            instances of delay or failures on the part of Company under this Section 14 (i.e. wherein Customer does not
            or otherwise cannot terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 14), Customer shall not be entitled to
            any service credit or refund.</p>
        <h2>15. Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Parties</h2>
        <p>The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding on the parties and all successors and permitted
            assigns of the foregoing. Company may assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any or all of
            its rights, burdens, duties or obligations under this Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition,
            sale of substantially all of its assets, or other corporate transaction, provided that such assignee has
            assumed in writing all of Company’s obligations under the Agreement and agreed to be bound by all the terms
            and conditions of the Agreement accruing or arising from and after the effectiveness of such assignment.
            Company will notify Customer in writing within ninety (90) days of any such change of control. To the extent
            the assignee is an entity prohibited from conducting business in the State in which the Customer is
            established, the Customer will have the option to terminate the Agreement. This Agreement is intended for
            the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties, is not intended to benefit any third party, and only the
            parties may enforce this Agreement.</p>
        <h2>16. Modification; Waiver</h2>

            in a writing that is signed by the parties hereto and expressly references this Agreement. No waiver of any
            breach of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any prior, concurrent or subsequent
            breach of the same or any other provisions hereof, and no waiver shall be effective unless made in writing
