<h3>General Principles applicable</h3>
<p>Regarding general principles applicable to the processing of personal data, FRVR ensures that this data is: </p>
<p>	â¢	Subject to lawful, fair and transparent processing;</p>
<p>	â¢	Collected for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes, not being later processed in an incompatible manner with those purposes;</p>
<p>	â¢	Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;</p>
<p>	â¢	Accurate and updated whenever necessary, taking all appropriate measures so that the inaccurate data, taking into account the purposes for which it is processed, is erased or rectified;</p>
<p>	â¢	Kept in a way that allows the identification of the user only for the period necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed; and</p>
<p>	â¢	Processed in a way that guarantees dataâs safety, including protection against its unauthorized or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage, implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures.</p>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>FRVRâs primary objective in collecting user information is to provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate and enjoy the Service. </p>
<p>When you install any of the FRVR games or applications, we may collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through third parties such as www.facebook.com (âFacebookâ) in accordance with the policies and terms of such third parties.</p>
<p>We may collect, process, store and transfer different types of data grouped by the following categories:</p>
<p>	â¢	Identification data such as first name, last name, gender, username, display name, city / region of the world (retrieved from IP address), unique ID (Facebook ID; Apple ID; FRVR ID) and global user ID (when it is possible to associate different types of IDs from different games and platforms), other advertisement IDs (IDFA; GAID);</p>
<p>	â¢	Contact data such as email address; </p>
<p>	â¢	Game data such as events, play session ID, play session time, days elapsed, games, among other;</p>

<p>We note that most of this information is treated without us knowing who the user is. This means that we cannot associate directly who is playing our games to a single person even though we receive information from third parties, we do not actively process identifiable data. We do however process personal data in games such as Worlds.</p>
<p>In the case of Facebook we might have access to your first name and Facebook profile photo URL but note that this information is not processed actively by us and we do not use it for other purposes than to send push messages through Facebook. Other information collected is last name, gender and names of Facebook, friends and Messenger connections that you provide us.</p>

<h3>Sources of data</h3>
<p>FRVR collects two types of data on our users: passive and active. </p>

<p>Passive sources data</p>
<p>Passive collection is data collected when users play games, whether on their mobile device or the web. This data contains the following information:</p>
<p>	â¢	City/region based on your IP address;</p>
<p>	â¢	Session duration;</p>
<p>	â¢	In-game activity - we may collect aggregated information including but not limited to internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We use this information to better tailor the Service to your interests, to provide you more efficient customer support, and to overall enhance the Service.</p>
<p>This data does not contain any personally identifying information. </p>

<p>Active sources data</p>
<p>Our active data collection is currently limited to gameplay information such as high scores or game session duration.</p>
<p>In the cases where users can and choose to provide information when using their Facebook account to log in, we store:</p>
<p>	â¢	User Access Token: we simply use this token to identify a user from one play session to the next. We do not gain access to any details about the user;</p>
<p>	â¢	If you use Facebook Instant Games and provide consent for such actions, we process your first name and Facebook photo URL to send push messages for our games through bot messages. We do not process this information in the same way we process usersâ game data and we do not track or identify our users through these data points. Users can turn off notifications as we explain in section XIV âUserâs rightsâ.</p>

<p>Admiralâs Data Collection</p>
<p>When using certain FRVR services that integrate with Admiralâs Ad Block Detection andManagement tool, additional data may be collected to assess ad-blocking trends and improve ad-serving strategies. The following data is collected only when interacting with FRVR games where Admiralâs technology is implemented:
</p><p>	â¢	IP Address â used for approximate location determination and fraud prevention.</p>
<p>	â¢	User-Agent â provides details about the browser and device type.</p>
<p>	â¢	URL â tracks the specific pages visited where Admiral is active.</p>
<p>	â¢	Ad Blocker Status â determines whether an ad blocker is enabled.</p>
<p>	â¢	First Party Unique Identifiers â may be used to track engagement over multiple sessions.</p>
<p>	â¢	Non-personal page-level metadata â provides context on the type of content displayed.</p>
<p>	â¢	Data regarding user interaction with Admiral messaging â tracks engagement with notifications related to ad-blocking.</p>
<p>	â¢	Script performance metrics â measures how well ad-serving technologies function.</p>
<p>This data is collected and sent to Admiralâs servers to assess the number of users utilizing Ad Blockers and to estimate the potential revenue impact of ad-blocking. FRVR does not use this data for user tracking beyond ad-block management, and all data is processed in accordance with GDPR.</p>

<h3>Other Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>You understand and agree that we may be required to disclose any personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability, to comply with legal process, including but not limited to a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and property, or that of the public. Note that FRVR is not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that FRVR may receive.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, customer information may be transferred to FRVRâs successor or assignee, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>FRVR uses cookies or similar technologies on its websites and games. For more information, please read our Cookie Policy.</p>

<h3>External Links</h3>
<p>The Service may contain links to other websites. The fact that the Service links to a website or presents a banner ad or other type of advertisement does not mean that FRVR has responsibility on what is shown to the users, nor it is a representation of our affiliation with that third party. FRVR is in no way responsible for the privacy policies of these other websites to which you choose to access from our Services. Please be sure to read the privacy policies of those websites when exiting our Services.</p>
<p>In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose to share additional information (e.g. through in-game chats) about yourself throughout our Services, such as in games or through other contacts. We remind you that any action you perform with other players is considered public and is of your sole discretion.</p>

<h3>Third Party Platform</h3>
<p>When you use or connect to a FRVR website or download a FRVR mobile app by or through a Third Party Platform, such as Facebook or other social networking site, you may consent  that FRVR accesses and/or collects information from that platform, if applicable, as informed by such services.  Those third parties may also collect information from your interactions with our services, that collection is managed by that third party, according to the terms of the agreement and your privacy settings with the third party Platform.  </p>

<h3>Data communication with third parties</h3>
<p>In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide will not be disclosed, rented, leased, loaned, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Service.</p>
<p>We do communicate your data to third parties but in an aggregated and anonymised form, which is not possible for these third parties to identify you as a person.</p>
<p>Thus we share your anonymised or aggregated information with the following third parties:</p>
<p>Analytics Partners â they allow us to better understand how users interact with our Services and help us improve them. These partners may also collect data via their own technologies although FRVR has no responsibility for these matters.</p>
<p>Advertisement Partners â we provide them slots for advertisements and these partners are solely responsible for the content they show to the users. We do not share your data with these entities.</p>
<p>Payment Partners â FRVR does not have payment partners. We do however have integrated payments on our platforms and these services are provided by the platforms where the users access their games.</p>
<p>Ad Block Detection and Management Partner â We partner with Admiral, a third-party service provider, to assess the number of users employing Ad Blockers and to analyze potential revenue recovery. Admiral may collect analytics data, including IP Address, User- Agent, URL, Ad Blocker status, First Party Unique Identifiers, page-level metadata, user interaction with ad-related messaging, and script performance metrics. This data is processed to evaluate ad-blocking trends and improve ad-serving strategies.</p>

<h3>International Transfers</h3>
<p>FRVR does not transfer personal data to organisations outside the European Economic Area, unless explicitly required for ad-block detection and management services, in which case, data is processed in compliance with GDPR and relevant data protection laws.</p>

<h3>Technical, Organisational and Security Measures</h3>
<p>We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal information through these mediums.</p>

<h3>Minors</h3>
<p>Services may be used by minors, submitted to permission given by parents or guardians. In case you are a minor and use the Services, you ensure and warrant towards us that you have obtained the necessary permission from your parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Our Services are classified according to the sensitivity of the content shown to our users. This classification materializes by establishing a minimum recommended age for playing our games. The minimum age established in each game might possibly differ based on games' content. This is not related to the processing of data.</p>
<p>As we mentioned previously, most of our user's game data is processed anonymously, thus we do not gear our Services towards children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we know that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information we will delete such information from our files as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 and do not understand the content presented in this Policy, please ask for support from your legal representatives - parents or legal guardians.</p>

<h3>UserÂ´s Rights</h3>
<p>Regarding personal data processing, our users dispose of rights that may be exercised through our dedicated contact form on our website here, by sending us an email to
gdpr@frvr.com or a letter to the address included in the Controller section of this Policy. Note that if a third-party data controller, such as an advertising partner or a payment processor, is responsible for the information, we will take reasonable steps to inform them of your request, but we recommend you contact them directly in accordance with their own privacy policies to ensure your rights are executed lawfully. Our users have the following rights:</p>

<p>	â¢	Right of Access: right to obtain confirmation that personal data concerning the user is or is not subject to processing and, if so, the right to access such personal data and certain information.</p>
<p>	â¢	Right of Rectification: right to rectify inaccurate personal data concerning the user or to request incomplete personal data to be completed.</p>
<p>	â¢	Right to Erasure: right to obtain the erasure of personal data, without undue delay as long as there are no valid grounds for its conservation, such as cases in which data has to be kept in order to comply with a legal obligation or because legal proceedings are underway.</p>
<p>	â¢	Right to restriction of processing: right to request a limitation on the processing of personal data, in the form of suspension of processing or limitation of the scope of processing to certain categories of data or processing purposes, in accordance with article 18 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>	â¢	The right to data portability: right to receive personal data that concerns the user in a structured, of common use and automatic reading format and / or the right to transmit this data to another controller.</p>
<p>	â¢	Right of Objection: right of the users to object to the processing of data at any time, as long as there are no legitimate reasons for such processing that prevail over the interests, rights and freedoms of the users, or for the purposes of declaration, exercise or defence of a right in a judicial proceeding.</p>

<p>You may revoke your consent, in processing activities dependent on obtaining consent, without such revocation invalidating the processing of the data while the consent was in force. This shall be applied to all services (games and website) provided by FRVR as long as the user provides the needed information.</p>

<p>You may also exercise your right of erasure or restriction of processing as what regards advertisement by resetting your mobile advertising identifier (IDFA or GAID) or activate âLimit Ad Trackingâ in your deviceâs settings in order to make previously collected data non linkable to you or your device anymore and limit further data collection.</p>


<h3>Data Breaches</h3>
<p>Although our data processing relies on an anonymised and aggregated basis data breaches might occur. In these cases, and if FRVR is aware of any risks to the data subjectÂ´s rights and freedoms we will report these breaches to the relevant Supervisory Authority within 72 hours from the moment we are aware of the occurrence. If the risk is considered high, we will also inform our users of the data breach and what FRVR has done to mitigate the risks and future similar breaches.</p>
<p>FRVR Limited has an escalated process to ensure the security of user data. Information about whether or not user data has been part of a breach is available upon request through our contracts made available in this Policy.</p>

<h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>By using our Services, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
