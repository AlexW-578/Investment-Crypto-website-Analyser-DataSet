      <h2>Certainly: trusted, secure, reliable and compliant</h2>
      <p>
        Certainly is Fastlyâs publicly-trusted Certification Authority (CA), giving Fastly
        customers the option to create and manage certificates issued by Certainly to
        secure any website or API endpoint served by Fastly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplify certificate management by automatically creating new TLS certificates to

        certify your websites and servers are secure. Certainly certificates offer a high
        level of trust and reliability, and are fully supported by Fastlyâs support team.
      </p>
      <p>
        With Certainly, you can rest easy knowing Fastly is in control of all of your
        certificate management needs.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Certainly?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tighter security and reduced risk:</strong> A 30-day validity period,
          coupled with automation, achieves a higher level of security, plus Certainly
          is not available on the public internet which provides even more protection
          for your certificates.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Simplified certificate management:</strong> Reduce the pain of managing
          certificates and renewals, even for hundreds of thousands of domains,
          with a dedicated, publicly trusted, certification authority.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>More reliable, better support:</strong> Put trust in Fastlyâs
          distributed, global delivery network for TLS certificates and remove the
          dependency on third-party providers. Fastly is in control of resolving any
          issues, from provisioning to renewing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>Supported clients:</b> Certainly certificates are trusted by most browsers, 
        operating systems, and devices released since 2010. Certainly certificates inherit 
        trust from an older trusted root certificate named the âStarfield Root Certificate 
        Authority - G2". The Starfield root was created in 2009 and is included in the 
        great majority of root stores released since then. This includes Apple iOS 4.1 and 
        higher, and newer versions of Android Gingerbread 2.3 and later.</p>
