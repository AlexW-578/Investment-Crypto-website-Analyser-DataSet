<p><strong>7. Payment</strong></p>
<p><strong>7.1 Payment Terms</strong></p>
<p>(A) Revenue Share Calculation. &nbsp;Playwire will pay you a “Revenue Share” based on Net Revenue as follows: &nbsp;(i) Fifty Percent (50%) of Net Revenue for all Direct Sales Advertising and (ii) Seventy Percent (70%) of Net Revenue for all Indirect Sales. &nbsp;Earnings, if any, are based solely on finalized reporting in the Playwire Dashboard. Playwire reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to increase the percentage paid to Publisher based on Publisher’s ad impression volume, as calculated solely by Playwire.<br><br><br>(B) Payment Terms. &nbsp;Playwire will pay you 60 days after the end of the month for which Net Revenue was collected (Net 60). &nbsp;All payments will be made in US Dollars. &nbsp;Publisher may select the manner in which Publisher receives its earnings from a selection provided in the Platform. Certain payment methods may be subject to additional fees of which the Publisher will be responsible. Publisher is responsible for keeping payment information current and accurate. Playwire reserves the right to withhold or adjust any payment to Publisher in the event of any reasonably suspected or actual violation of this Agreement. In the event Publisher earnings for any given month are less than the applicable payment threshold, Playwire reserves the right to roll such payment over month to month until the applicable payment threshold has been met. Should Publisher have a dispute and/or a question related to any calculation in the Playwire Dashboard, Publisher must submit a ticket in the platform within ten (10) business days of the transaction in question. Playwire will respond within ten (10) business days of your submission. It is within Playwire’s sole discretion how such disputes and/or questions are resolved. Failure to notify Playwire of a dispute within the time period noted will be deemed a waiver of such dispute.&nbsp;<br><br><br>(C) All Advertising billing, invoicing and collection shall be Agent’s responsibility provided, however, that Agent shall not be obligated or required to bring any lawsuit or engage any collection action to recover Advertising revenue. Agent does not represent, warrant or guarantee that any payment will be made by any Advertiser, irrespective of whether the Advertising has been recognized, and Agent shall not be liable to Publisher, in any way, for any non-payment by any Advertiser. Agent’s calculation of the Advertising Net Revenue shall be final and binding, absent manifest error.<br>&nbsp;<br>(D) Uncashed Checks. If Playwire mails a check for a payment due to you under this Agreement to the last known address, you must cash said check within six (6) months of the date of the check or, failing so to do, you agree that: (i) the funds represented by the uncashed check shall be disposed of without further notice as provided herein; (ii) if your last known address is in a state that has a business to business exemption in its unclaimed property laws, you agree that you shall have no further interest in the funds represented by the uncashed check, and Playwire shall succeed to your interests therein; (iii) for all other publishers, the funds represented by the uncashed check shall be deemed abandoned under applicable unclaimed property law; and (iv) you agree that six (6) months is a reasonable period after the expiration of which the actions described above shall be taken.<br>&nbsp;<br>(E) Withholding Payment. Playwire reserves the right to withhold payment from you if you have engaged in activity that is deceptive or fraudulent in nature as determined by Playwire in its sole discretion.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>(F) Taxes. Playwire assumes no responsibility for paying income taxes on your behalf. By participating in the System, Platform and Networks, you assume complete and sole responsibility for any taxes owed as a consequence of such participation and agree to indemnify and hold Playwire harmless from any such taxes. Playwire shall provide you with appropriate tax information, including earnings on Form 1099 as required by applicable law. If you reside in the United States, then you agree to provide your Social Security number or Federal Employee Identification Number and any other reasonable information to Playwire for tax reporting purposes. Such information will be used for no purpose other than for tax reporting purposes. If you reside outside of the United States, then you may be asked to complete appropriate forms for tax purposes and agree to accurately complete such forms. Playwire may withhold payment from you in the event that you do not provide accurate tax information or complete any necessary tax or reporting forms, as determined in Playwire’s sole and absolute discretion. &nbsp;When Playwire has the legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes, Publisher will be invoiced, and agrees to pay the invoiced amount unless Publisher provides Playwire with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.<br>&nbsp;<br>(G) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Advertiser files for bankruptcy or any other similar proceeding (a “Bankruptcy”) at any time and for any reason, then Playwire will not be responsible for paying any amounts to you that are not collected as a result of the such Bankruptcy. If Playwire has already pre-paid any amounts to you and Playwire is unable to collect a payment from an Advertiser as a result of a Bankruptcy or for any other reason whatsoever then, in Playwire’s sole and absolute discretion, you shall pay back such pre-paid amounts or Playwire may take a credit against future payments to you. Furthermore, if Playwire is required to repay any amounts as a result of such Bankruptcy and any amount have been paid in whole or in part to you, then you shall immediately return any amounts paid pursuant to the Revenue Share which are subject to such Bankruptcy.</p>
<p>7.2 Advertising Rates.&nbsp;<br>Playwire will determine all Advertising rates for Advertising sold by Agent and may change the rates, in Agent's sole discretion, without notice from time to time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>8. Title and Ownership.</strong></p>

<p>Publisher shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Playwire and its suppliers and resellers and their respective officers, employees, licensors, agents, and affiliates against any and all claims, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses) arising out of or in connection with the Content and/or your use (which includes use by your employees, agents, customers, and users) of the Services, Platforms and Networks, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to Prohibited Activities or Prohibited Content or your breach of any of these Terms, Platforms and Networks, including but not limited to any of the representations or warranties set forth herein.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>12. Limitation of Liability.</strong></p>
<p>You expressly understand and agree that under no circumstances shall Playwire or its suppliers, resellers, or licensors be liable to you or any End User based on your or that End User’s use or misuse of and/or reliance on the Services, Platforms and/or Networks or the content you retrieve by or through the Services, Platforms and/or Networks.

Such limitation shall also apply with respect to damages incurred by reason of other services or goods received through or advertised on the Services or received through any links provided in the Services, as well as by reason of any information or advice received through or advertised on the Services or received through any links provided in or through the Services.
