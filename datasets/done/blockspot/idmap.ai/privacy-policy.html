            If an individual has an unresolved complaint or concern that is not addressed satisfactorily, IDMAP agrees to cooperate and comply with the EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection Information Commissioner (FDPIC) regarding the unresolved complaints of data subjects who are located in the EU and Switzerland. Such individuals may direct complaints about their personal information to their respective DPA. For the contact information for your countryâs DPA, please contact us at the address given below. IDMAP commits to cooperate with DPAs and the FDPIC, and to comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to non-human resources data transferred from the EU and Switzerland in the context of any relevant employment relationship.

            <p>Tracking.Â Currently, our Services do not recognize browser do-not-track
              signals. However, you may manage how your browser handles cookies and related
              technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so
              refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other
              privacy and security settings that may be available. The Help portion of the toolbar on
              most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies,
              how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
              cookies altogether.

              <p>You can manage the sharing of certain personal data when you register
                with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook
                Connect or Google. Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media platform or
                application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the
                interactivity between us and your social media account. By registering with us through a
                social media platform, you grant us permission to access all of the elements of your
                social network profile information that you have chosen to share with us and to use it in

              <p>In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act,
                we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the
                Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal
                Information, we do not respond to Web browsersâ âdo not trackâ signals. Californiaâs
                âShine the Lightâ law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California
                residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal
                Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a
                California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from                
                gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact
                details set out in Section 17 below.

                  the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your 
                  own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does
                  not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your 
                  Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases). Requests should be submitted by contacting us at
