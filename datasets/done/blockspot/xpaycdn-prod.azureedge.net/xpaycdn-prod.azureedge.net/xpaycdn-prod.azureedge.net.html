We are the only organization that integrates advocacy, discovery, and direct patient support to measurably improve the lives of cancer patients and their families.  As the largest nongovernmental cancer organization, we are working in more than 5,000 communities across the nation with a mission to  eliminate cancer as a major health problem.\\n\\nFrom 1991 to 2019, there has been a 32% decline in cancer mortality. We can directly attribute declines in the overall cancer death rate to investment of funds and resources in the areas of advocacy, discovery, and direct patient support. Our discovery research leads to breakthroughs in preventing, finding, and treating cancer. Our advocacy work removes barriers to care so people in every community can have an opportunity to access those breakthroughs. Through direct patient support, we connect people in every community with essential programs and support services throughout their cancer journey, touching 55 million lives in 2021 alone. Because while cancer affects everyone, it does not affect everyone equally. Through our commitment to these areas of focus, we are working to ensure everyone has a fair and just opportunity to prevent, detect, treat, and survive cancer. \\n\\nAdvocacy \u2013 By activating grassroots volunteers nationwide, the American Cancer Society Cancer Action NetworkSM (ACS CAN) fights cancer in city halls, statehouses, and Congress by elevating the patient voice to advance policy change.

As the largest nonprofit funder of cancer research in the US outside of the federal government, we\u0027ve invested more than $3.1 billion in cancer research since 1991, contributing to the 3.5 million fewer cancer deaths as a result of breakthroughs. We continue to build on this progress by: \\n   \u2022\tCurrently investing more than $400 million in multi-year grants at more than 174 \\n        institutions nationwide, spanning the entire cancer journey from prevention to \\n        detection to treatment to survivorship\\n   \u2022\tFunding grant projects to eliminate health disparities, with a focus on prevention, \\n        early detection, and access to care in communities who have been marginalized\\n   \u2022\tConducting research focused on early detection and survivorship and disseminating \\n        evidence-based reports such as Cancer Statistics, which is the most widely cited \\n        oncology publication each year\\n   \u2022\tInvesting in the future of cancer research through our Diversity in Cancer Research \\n        program, which provides grants to foster a more diverse cancer care and research \\n        workforce and ultimately better equip the scientific community in addressing \\n        inequities that exist in cancer prevention, treatment, and care\\n\\nPatient Support \u2013 The American Cancer Society works to ensure no one feels alone at any point on their cancer journey, from prevention to detection and diagnosis, through treatment and survivorship, and, for some, the end of life.

(LDF) is the country\u2019s first and foremost civil and human rights legal organization. Initially the legal arm of the NAACP, LDF has been a wholly separate and independent organization with its own Board of Directors for nearly 60 years. LDF was founded by legendary civil rights icon Thurgood Marshall at a time when the nation\u2019s aspirations for equality and due process of law were stifled by widespread state-sponsored racial inequality. Marshall led LDF to the 1954 landmark victory in Brown v. Board of Education ending the doctrine of \u201Cseparate but equal\u201D and outlawing segregation in our nation. Marshall later became the first African-American Justice of the United States Supreme Court. LDF has acquired an unparalleled record of expert legal advocacy in state and federal courts and its legal victories serve as the foundation for the civil rights that all Americans enjoy today.\\n\\nLDF works to secure full and fair access to democratic citizenship by promoting equality in education, voting and political participation, economic justice and criminal justice. Among its current priorities, LDF seeks to: 1) increase equity in education by increasing graduation rates (K-12 and college) among African Americans; 2) foster adoption of racially equitable and research-based approaches to school discipline; 3) ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act, National Voter Registration Act, and other voting rights laws; 4) ensure that the job selection process does not negatively impact African Americans; 5) reduce employment barriers to those with criminal records; and, 6) decrease disproportionate incarceration and sentencing as well as racially biased exercise of discretion by police and prosecutors. Historically, LDF has worked through the courts and through advocacy to the executive and legislative branches.  LDF also uses educational outreach, monitoring of federal and state government activity, coalition-building and policy research to advance its mission. Additionally, through its scholarship, fellowship, and internship programs, LDF helps students to attend and graduate from many of the nation\u2019s best colleges, universities, and law schools and to develop a lasting commitment to racial justice and public service.\\n\\nToday, LDF\u2019s mission encompasses not only precedent-setting litigation and policy initiatives, but also strategic campaigns informed by the latest and most innovative developments in social and political science, and economics. Through the Thurgood Marshall Institute (est. 2015), LDF is combining its traditional litigation strength with a new multidisciplinary approach to advocacy. \\n\\nLDF is advancing the goals of racial justice and equality, transforming America into a more just and inclusive society.","countryCode":"US","categoryCode":"R","category":"Civil Rights, Social Action, and Advocacy","subCategoryCode":"R22-0","subCategory":"Minority Rights","logos":["https://logos.benevity.org/50x50/public/clogos/840-131655255.jpg","https://logos.benevity.org/150x150/public/clogos/840-131655255.jpg","https://logos.benevity.org/300x300/public/clogos/840-131655255.jpg","https://logos.benevity.org/400x400/public/clogos/840-131655255.jpg"],"causeCaption":"Through litigation, advocacy, and public education, LDF seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities, and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans.","causeAddress":"40 Rector Street, 5th Floor","causeCity":"NEW YORK","causeState":"New York","causePostalCode":"10006","website":"www.naacpldf.org"},{"projectId":"840-135613797","projectName":"American Heart Association","causeId":"840-135613797","causeName":"American Heart Association","description":"The six cardiologists who founded the American Heart Association in 1924 would be amazed.\\n\\nFrom humble beginnings, the AHA has grown into the nation\u2019s oldest and largest voluntary organization dedicated to fighting heart disease and stroke.

LLS funds lifesaving cancer research around the world and provides free information and support services to blood cancer patients and their families.\\n\\nOrganization Description \\nThe Leukemia \u0026 Lymphoma Society (LLS) was born out of a family\u0027s grief following the death of their son, who was 16 when he succumbed to leukemia in 1944. Frustrated by the lack of effective treatments for what was then a hopeless disease, parents Rudolph and Antoinette de Villiers started a fundraising and education organization. Driven by the de Villiers\u0027s nearly boundless belief that leukemia was indeed curable, the foundation grew steadily, opening its first offices in the New York City area. \\n\\nToday, LLS, a 501(c)(3) organization, is the largest not-for-profit health agency dedicated to finding cures and better treatments for people with blood cancer, funding cutting-edge research worldwide to advance breakthrough therapies and bring them to more patients faster. With the size and scope to fund research on a scale that makes progress happen, LLS funds more blood cancer research than any other organization. Advised by leading biomedical research and clinical experts, LLS identifies and funds the most promising blood cancer research found anywhere and has invested more than $1.3 billion in research to advance therapies and save lives. Unlike corporations that invest in drugs offering the best profit potential, LLS funds research based on unmet medical needs of blood cancer patients, without restriction by commercial return, market size or geography. \\n\\nLLS recognizes that finding cures is not enough; we must ensure that patients have access to the treatments they need. Through diverse and extensive outreach initiatives, we advocate, educate, assist and support patients and fight for them at the national and state levels. With the help of trained volunteers, our policy team influences crucial legislation to accelerate research and break down barriers to treatment. Each year, our Information Specialists, all master\u2019s-level health care professionals, respond to nearly 20,000 inquiries, and that number continues to grow. Annually, LLS distributes 600,000 educational booklets and fact sheets about specific diseases to patients and families around the country. And in 2019, more than 600 patients received in-depth clinical trial support from our industry-leading Clinical Trial Support Center. A support to patients when they need it most, LLS distributed nearly $5 million in relief funds to more than 19,000 patients during the global pandemic. \\n\\nHistory \\nLLS was born out of a family\u0027s grief following the death of their son, who was 16 years old when he succumbed to leukemia in 1944. Five years later, frustrated by the lack of effective treatments for what was then considered a hopeless disease, parents Rudolph and Antoinette de Villiers started a fundraising and education organization in their son\u0027s name. The task was daunting. Most leukemia patients, especially children, died within three months. Driven by the de Villiers\u0027 belief that leukemia was indeed curable, the foundation grew steadily, opening its first offices in the New York City area. \\n\\nToday, LLS is the largest voluntary health agency dedicated to funding research, finding cures and ensuring access to treatments for patients. A philanthropic, service-driven organization, our reach and impact are profound. With 27 regional teams working in 70 offices to support communities across the United States, LLS\u2019s vision is to support all patients and families coping with a blood cancer diagnosis. With both a fundraising and patient support agenda, each regional team is a resource for patients, families and healthcare professionals, raising awareness and providing services in communities across the country. Critical fundraising efforts provide resources to fuel the three distinct and interrelated pillars of the LLS mission: research, patient access, and advocacy.\\n\\nResearch-focused\\nOur donor partnerships have made possible an investment of more than $1.3 billion in research since our founding 70 years ago, and together we have contributed to virtually every major development in the treatment of blood cancers.\\n\\nSince inception, LLS has established a track record of involvement in groundbreaking advancements. In 1951, the research of LLS advisers George H. Hitchings, PhD, and Gertrude B. Elion, DSc, led to the most widely used antileukemia drugs, earning Hitchings and Elion them the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. LLS adviser J. Michael Bishop, MD, also a Nobel Prize winner, established an early understanding of the genetics of cancer with the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s. One of our first grant recipients, James Holland, MD, pioneered combination therapy for blood cancer. More recently, LLS support helped Brian Druker, MD, develop the breakthrough drug Gleevec, and we partnered with Carl June, MD, in realizing CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T-cell immunotherapy.\\n\\nThe cumulative impact of seven decades of investment in better treatments is profound and has led to significant increases in survival rates: blood cancer mortality has seen an average decline of 32 percent over the past three decades and continues to drop. \\n\\nProblem/Need \\nProgress is critical for the nearly 1.4 million people in the United States who are living with or in remission from blood cancer. This year alone, leukemia, lymphoma or myeloma will be diagnosed in 176,200 people. That amounts to one person receiving a blood cancer diagnosis every three minutes. Of those people, more than one-third will not survive five years after their diagnosis. One life is lost to blood cancer every nine minutes in the United States.\\n\\nCures are meaningful only when they are available to the patients who need them. LLS\u2019s mission focuses on equally supporting patients, families and health care professionals with information, education and access to the very best care possible. Representing the interests of patients and families, we fight for public policy at the state and federal levels to ensure that patients receive quality, affordable, coordinated care. \\n\\nCAMPAIGN DESCRIPTIONS: \\n\\nLIGHT THE NIGHT: A community event where patients, caregivers and supporters walk to celebrate, honor and remember those touched by cancer.
