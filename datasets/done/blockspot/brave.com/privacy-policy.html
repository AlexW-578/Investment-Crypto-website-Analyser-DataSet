We don’t collect personal information
about you, your device or your searches. We also don’t transmit information to the web
that could be used to profile you or track you or learn anything about you. Your searches are
private to YOU.</p>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>You can provide us with anonymous feedback at any time. Please do not provide
any personal data in the feedback form. <a href="/help/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<h4>Usage metrics</h4>
<p>If you allow us, we’d like to obtain anonymous and aggregated metrics to help us improve Brave
Search. By metrics we mean, aggregated data about things such as the number of visits
daily/weekly/monthly to Brave Search. How many users have chosen to leave feedback. The operating
system of the device you visited us from (for example, Android, Windows or macOS). Metrics data
can’t be used to identify you or your device or to learn anything about you individually.
<a href="/help/usage-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<h4>Anonymous local results</h4>
<p>Brave Search provides the option to opt-out of anonymous local results. With anonymous
local results, when you search for “cafes near me” or “food near me” Brave Search will
use the IP address broadcast by your device but without sharing that IP address and
without storing it. This means we can’t tie your searches to you and your location.
Nor can anyone else. It remains private to you. <a href="/help/anonymous-local-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<h4>Ads on Brave Search</h4>
<p>Brave will record clicks and views of Ads promoted on <a href="https://search.brave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brave Search</a>.
This is to help Brave measure the effectiveness of Brave Search Ads. No personal data is processed.
We cannot link the measurement data back to individuals or their devices, nor build profiles of
individuals or their devices over time. <a href="/help/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>We also infer the country location associated with clicks and views of Ads on Brave Search. This is based on a device IP address.  We do not retain IP addresses.</p>
<h4>Goggles</h4>
<p>We have taken care to ensure that Brave does not process data that relates to individuals or
from which individuals can be identified, when they use Goggles. Learn more about
<a href="/help/goggles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goggles</a>.</p>
<h4>Google fallback mixing</h4>
<p>As a new search engine and as the ranking index and algorithms for Brave Search are refined
it’s possible that a search may not return the results you were expecting. In this case, you
can choose to enable Google Fallback Mixing. If you choose this, Brave will anonymously
check Google search and mix the results in the Brave browser and add the clicked result to
Brave’s search index. <a href="/help/google-fallback" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<h4>Service Integrity</h4>
<p>We temporarily process IP addresses to detect and prevent bots in order to ensure the
integrity and availability of the service for all users. IP addresses are not retained
but are deleted within seconds.</p>
<h3>Right to be forgotten</h3>
<p>Like other search engines, Brave Search has a <a href="/help/brave-search-crawler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web crawler</a> to discover
new webpages and index their content. The index we create is independent of other search engines.
Brave Search results are served solely from this index.</p>
<p>You may have the Right to be Forgotten and to Object—that is, to have Brave Search de-list any
webpage that has published personal data about you.
<a href="/help/brave-search-index-right-to-be-forgotten" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>To learn more details about the above and Brave Search please visit the <a href="/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help pages</a>.</p>
