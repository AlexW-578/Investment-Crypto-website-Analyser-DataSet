    <strong>NOTICE</strong>: We have updated our Privacy Policy effective May
    31, 2023. We did this primarily (1) to notify Users about our COPPA, FERPA,
    and California Student Privacy certifications issued by iKeepSafe (please
    see below for more information); (2) to create more consistency in how we
    explain our student data practices across this Privacy Policy, our Terms of
    Use, and our Client Agreements; and (3) to add language about new laws that
    may apply to you. We believe the rights and obligations of Users and Apptegy
    did not materially change as a result of this update. However, we encourage
    you to review the updated Privacy Policy below, which applies to all Users
    of the Services on a going-forward basis.

    except as expressly set out in the Terms of Use.
</p>
<p><strong>2. WHAT We Collect and How We Collect It</strong></p>
<p>
    What information we collect about you and how we collect it depends on our
    relationship with you. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a Client (for example: a School that is our Client), then an
        explanation of what information we collect about you and your End Users,
        and how we collect it, can be found below in the section 2.A titled
        “Personal Information from Schools and Under School Accounts”; or
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are an End User (for example: a teacher, staff, student, parent,
        or guardian added to the Services by a School), then information we
        collect about you is provided either (1) by the School that added you to
        the Services and manages your use of the Services, (2) by you when you
        use the Services, or (3) by another End User using the Services under
        the account of your School. An explanation of what information we
        collect about you and how we collect it can be found below in the
        section 2.A titled “Personal Information from Schools and Under School
        Accounts”; or
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are a Visitor (for example: an individual browsing a public part
        of the Sites that does not require a log-in or an invitation from a
        Client) and you do not use the Services as an End User, then an
        explanation of what information we collect about you and how we collect
        it can be found below in the section 2.B titled “Visitor Personal
        information.”
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note that our Clients are Schools and other government entities. We
    do not currently offer or provide Client accounts to individuals, including
    End Users or Visitors. This means that Apptegy does not have direct
    relationships with individual end users of the Services. However, the
    Services allow Clients to create individual user accounts for the End Users
    that the Client wants to authorize under its Client account (for example:
    teachers, staff, students, parents, and guardians associated with the
    School). All End User accounts are controlled and managed by the Client that
    creates them. In this Policy we call the individual End User accounts
    created by Schools “<strong>School-Created User Accounts</strong>.” We
    collect limited personal information from or about individuals outside of
    School-Created User Accounts. This means that nearly all personal
    information we collect and use is provided either (1) by Schools adding or
    managing their End Users on the Services, or (2) by End Users using the
    Services under School-Created User Accounts. Please continue reading below
    for more information.
</p>
<p>2.A Personal Information from Schools and Under School Accounts</p>
<p>
    As stated above, nearly all of the personal information that we collect is
    provided to us either by a School on behalf of the End Users associated with
    the School, or by End Users using our Services under School-Created User
    Accounts.
</p>
<p>A few examples of when this may happen include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        a School creates School-Created User Accounts for teachers, staff,
        parents, guardians, and students under the School’s Client account, and
        includes personal information in the School-Created User Accounts;
    </li>
    <li>
        a School administrator, under her or his School-Created User Account,
        uses the Services to update School-Created User Accounts, and includes
        personal information in her or his updates;
    </li>
    <li>
        a School principal, under her or his School-Created User Account, uses
        the Services to publish a communication via Thrillshare Media that
        includes personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
        a School teacher, under her or his School-Created User Account, uses the
        Services to send classroom communications via Thrillshare Rooms that
        includes personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
        a School student, under her or his School-Created User Account, uses the
        Services to upload and submit classroom content and assignments via
        Thrillshare Rooms that includes personal information;
    </li>
    <li>
        a parent or guardian of a School student, under her or his
        School-Created User Account, uses the Services to communicate with a
        teacher via Thrillshare Rooms, and includes personal information in her
        or his communications; or
    </li>
    <li>
        a School staff member interacts with Apptegy team members to request
        technical support for the School’s Client account, and includes personal
        information in her or his communications.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In all of these instances, (i) the School determines and controls what
    personal information it provides to us for its School-Created User Accounts,
    (ii) the School determines and controls what personal information can be
    provided to us by End Users using the Services under the School-Created User
    Accounts; and (iii) the School determines and controls how personal
    information is and can be used once it is collected from the School and End
    Users under the School’s Client account. In other words, the School
    determines and controls the purpose, scope, and means for all personal
    information collected under or in connection with the School’s account. This
    means the School is the data controller of the personal information
    collected by us in connection with the School’s account and the
    School-Created User Accounts associated with the School.
</p>
<p>
    Because of that, if you are an End User, your School is the party that is
    primarily responsible for the personal information we collect about you. And
    your School is the party responsible for determining the purpose, scope, and
    means of the personal information we collect about you, and whether and how
    it is used via our Services. We use that information only on behalf of and
    under the direct control of the School, and not for our own purposes.
</p>
<p>
    We implement safeguards to protect against the loss, disclosure, alteration,
    or misuse of personal information that is in our care or custody. We protect
    all personal information in our care or custody with at least the degree of
    care that would be exercised by a prudent person given the sensitivity of
    the personal information. Please continue reading below for more information
    about our security practices.
</p>
<p>
    In all of these circumstances, Apptegy is only a data processor. This means
    we only carry out and process, via our Services, the activities of and
    instructions of your School (and End Users using the Services under
    School-Created User Accounts).
</p>
<p>
    <strong
        >Simply put: when we process activities and instructions from a School
        that include personal information about you </strong
    >(<strong
        >or by you or another School-Created User Account under a School</strong
    >
    <strong
        >account), we are not responsible for the disclosures made or the use of
        your personal information by the School</strong
    >
    <strong>(or School-Created User Account under the</strong>
    <strong>School</strong>
    <strong
        >account). It is your School that has the responsibility to protect your
        privacy in these instances.</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the privacy and security policies of your School may differ
    from our policies. In those cases, our policies will not overrule or change
    the separate policies of your School, and our policies will not impact or
    change your School’s separate agreements with and obligations to you.
    <strong>Instead, the</strong>
    <strong>privacy and security policies of your School</strong>
    <strong
        >govern your personal information and your rights with respect to your
        School, and not our policies</strong
    >. As such, you are required to work with your School directly with respect
    to your personal information. For example, if you request a copy of the
    personal information we hold about you in order to provide the Services, we
    will direct you to your School for that information.
</p>
<p>
    Even though we are not primarily responsible for your personal information
    in these circumstances, we still want you to understand what personal
    information we might collect about you as the data processor providing the
    Services and how we collect it.
</p>
<p>
    Schools (and End Users under School-Created User Accounts) typically use our
    Services to publish, upload, manage, store, and/or send communications,
    messages, announcements, videos, assignments, materials, electronic
    signature requests, and other content, documents, and information.
    Thrillshare Media is typically used when the activity is relevant to the
    School and its End Users generally; Thrillshare Rooms is typically used when
    the activity is relevant to a particular subset of the School’s End Users –
    usually a classroom or group at the School.
</p>
<p>
    However, personal information may be collected for or as a result of any of
    the activities permitted on the Services. As explained above, Schools (and
    End Users under School-Created User Accounts) make these choices and are
    responsible for them.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, the following personal information may be collected in
    connection with the Services:
</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<ul>
    <li>
        Personal information provided by Schools. We collect personal
        information that Schools use to create and manage School-Created User
        Accounts. We also collect personal information that Schools include in
        the communications, messages, announcements, videos, assignments,
        materials, electronic signature requests, and other content, documents,
        and information published, uploaded, managed, stored, and/or sent via
        the Services. Some of this information may contain personal information;
        and some personal information may be about you. For example: personal
        information included in announcements made via Media, or personal
        information included in messages in Rooms. As noted above, however, we
        only collect this information when provided by Schools and End Users
        using the Services under School-Created User Accounts (for example:
        teachers and staff). Personal information provided by Schools may

        <em>Personal information from use of the Services</em>. We automatically
        collect information about how the Services are used by End Users under
        School-Created User Accounts (for example: teachers, staff, students,
        parents, and guardians). We may also collect information connected with
        support and technical help for the Services. Some of this information
        may contain personal information; and some personal information may be
        about you. Personal information from use of the Services may include:

<p>
    As explained above, the personal information we collect from Schools and End
    Users is under the direct control of the School, and we only collect
    personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide the Services
    requested by the Client and its End Users. This means that, with respect to
    any specific Client and its End Users, the types and scope of personal
    information actually collected by us will depend on the Services being used
    by the Client and its End Users. Not all categories will be collected or
    received for every individual.
</p>
<p>
    Except as set out in these policies, we do not collect or scrape additional
    personal information from the computers, contacts, email accounts, or other
    personal sources of Users.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that while we have attempted to provide full and fair notice of
    the personal information that may be collected in connection with our
    Services, the list above is not exhaustive. We may in some instances collect
    personal information other than what is set out in the table above. In those
    circumstances, we will ensure we have appropriate authority or consent for
    that collection.
</p>
<p>
    If you are an End User and have questions or requests about personal
    information or rights under your School’s Client account or your
    School-Created User Account, please address your questions and requests
    directly to your School. If you contact us regarding these questions and
    requests, we will direct them to your School. If you are a Client and have
    questions or requests about personal information or rights under your Client
    account, please contact us by any of the methods set out above in the
    introduction to these policies or below in the section 10 titled “Contact
    Us.”

    2.B Visitor Personal Information; Generalized and Anonymous Information
    about All Users
</p>
<p>
    If you are a Visitor (for example: an individual browsing a public part of
    the Sites that does not require a log-in or an invitation from a Client), we
    collect limited personal information from and about you. We automatically
    collect information about how the public parts of the Services are used by
    Visitors. For example, we collect information about the individual pages
    that are viewed, the features and functions that are used and how they are
    used, and other information about how Visitors interact with the Services.
    We also collect information about what web browsers, devices, and IP
    addresses are used to access the Services, and the general geolocation of
    that access (but not precise geolocation). Some of this information may
    contain personal information (for example: IP addresses). Please also note
    that if you choose to contact us (for example: send us a message via the
    email or chat function on the Sites), we collect the personal information
    that you give us (for example: name, phone number, email address, IP
    address, and anything you include in the body of your message). In these
    circumstances, you control what information you provide us. If you choose to
    not provide certain information, parts of the Services may not be available
    to you or may not function as intended (for example: you may be required to
    provide certain personal information to send a communication to us). If you
    have questions or requests about your personal information or rights as a
    Visitor, please contact us by any of the methods set out above in the
    introduction to these policies or below in the section 10 titled “Contact
    Us.”
</p>
<p>
    We may collect and use generalized, anonymous information about all Users.
    This information cannot be used to identify you or isolate your personal
    information. If you have questions or requests about your personal
    information or rights in connection with our collection of generalized,
    anonymous information, please contact us by any of the methods set out above
    in the introduction to these policies or below in the section 10 titled
    “Contact Us.”

        arising from agreements with Clients and Users, including our Terms of
        Use, and for billing and collection purposes;

        <em>To measure and improve client engagement</em>: We may use and/or

        how our users use our Services – you can read more about how Google uses
        our information here: https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/
        and you can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:

        understand how our users use our Services – you can read more about how
        Pendo uses our information here:
        https://www.pendo.io/legal/privacy-policy/);<em> </em>and
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>For corporate business purposes</em>: We may use and disclose
        personal information (a) to our current or future parent company,
        affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and
        ownership, or (b) to a buyer or other successor in connection with, or
        during negotiations for, a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or other
        sale or transfer of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of
        bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We may use and disclose personal information with and to third parties when
    it is necessary to provide the Services or for our business (for example: to
    complete any of the foregoing activities; or when we need to process
    payments from Clients; or when we translate content that includes personal
    information from English into other languages; or when we comply with
    appropriate security standards). When we use and disclose personal
    information with third parties, the third parties are not allowed to access
    or use personal information of Users, unless it is needed to do their
    particular work with us. We will limit the personal information we provide
    to third parties as much as possible, and we will condition our sharing of
    that personal information on strict confidentiality restrictions and
    security instructions as often as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Some examples of third parties that may receive personal information as a
    necessary part of providing the Services are Amazon Web Services (hosting
    provider), Google (communications, translations, analytics), Zoom
    (communications), Salesforce (Client relationship management), Pendo
    (analytics), AppSignal (product performance management), IMImobile (text
    messaging facilitator), and Intercom (Client support). For a list of third
    parties with whom we share personal information, please contact us by email
    at <a href="mailto:privacy@apptegy.com">privacy@apptegy.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that some personal information provided by Schools and End Users
    on the Services may be viewable by the public generally (for example: a
    School message posted on Facebook via Thrillshare Media); and some personal
    information provided by Schools and End Users on the Services may be
    viewable by other Users (for example: a message posted on a group message
    via Thrillshare Rooms where other School-Created User Accounts in the Room
    have permission to view). As explained above, Schools and End Users under
    School-Created User Accounts make those choices and are responsible for
    them.
</p>
<p>
    When we use and/or disclose personal information for legal purposes or in
    connection with our corporate business purposes, we will limit the personal
    information we provide as much as possible, and we will condition our
    sharing of that personal information on strict confidentiality restrictions
    and security instructions as often as possible.

        >Please note that we will not use or disclose information (whether
        personal or otherwise) about individual students collected from Schools
        or School-Created User Accounts for the purpose of commercial marketing
        or targeted advertising.</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    We may use and disclose anonymized or generalized (non-identifiable)
    aggregated information with third parties for various reasons, including to
    promote and improve our Services. In these circumstances, we will take
    appropriate measures to de-identify (and prevent any party from
    re-identifying) any information used or disclosed in this way.
</p>
<p><strong>4. ADVERTISING AND MARKETING; TRACKING; OPT-OUT</strong></p>
<p>
    As explained above, if you are a School or a teacher, administrator, or
    staff member under a School-Created User Account, we may use your
    information for limited advertising and marketing purposes, including to
    contact you about Services that we believe may be of interest to you, and to
    promote other Apptegy resources and events. We will not contact End Users
    that we know are parents, guardians, and students with respect to the
    foregoing.
</p>
<p>
    Our marketing communications will include instructions for how to opt-out of
    these communications or change your communication preferences. You may also
    contact us by email at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@apptegy.com">privacy@apptegy.com</a> to manage your
    marketing communication preferences at any time. Please note that certain
    information is required to use parts of the Services as intended (for
    example: to receive the communications sent by your School).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that End User accounts are controlled and managed by the Client
    that added the End User to the Services (for example: the School that is
    your employer or that you attend as a student). In some instances, End Users
    that want to manage, change, disable, or deactivate their account or account
    preferences must contact the Client that invited or added them to the
    Services. Please see our Terms of Use for more information.
</p>
<p>
    We use cookies, beacons, and other similar tracking technologies. These are
    small text files containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers)
    that are sent by a website server to your browser when you visit a website
    and are stored in your browser. We only use these technologies for the
    purpose of providing and improving our Services for our Users. A few
    examples include: we use cookies that are necessary for the Services to
    function (for example: to remember your cookie preferences), to personalize
    the Services and to recognize you when you return to the Services (for
    example: to remember your language preferences), to help us measure and
    improve engagement with Users (for example: to analyze the usage trends and
    patterns for our different products), and to promote Services that we
    believe may be of interest to you. We do not use the technologies for third
    party targeted marketing or advertising purposes. In some cases, you may
    manage the use of cookies for our Services by adjusting your individual
    browser settings. You may learn more about managing cookies here:
    <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/?ref=apptegy.com"
        >https://www.aboutcookies.org/</a
    >. Please note that our Services do not currently process “do not track”
    features offered by some browsers and devices. Please also note that if you
    do not allow certain cookies, then the Services may not function properly.
</p>
<p>
    We will not use or disclose information (whether personal or otherwise)
    about individual students collected from Schools or School-Created User
    Accounts for the purpose of commercial marketing or targeted advertising.

<p><strong>5. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY NOTICE</strong></p>
<p>
    This California Privacy Notice describes how we as a business collect, use,
    disclose, and otherwise process personal information of individual residents
    of the State of California within the scope of the California Consumer
    Privacy Act of 2018 (“<strong>CCPA</strong>,” as amended by the California
    Privacy Rights Act of 2020, and its implementing regulations).
</p>
<p>
    This California Privacy Notice applies only to individual users of our
    Services who are residents of the State of California, and only where we act
    as a “business” with or for that individual. For example, this section may
    apply for California residents who use our Services as a Visitor. For
    applicable Users, this section is a supplement to the other parts of this
    Policy.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you are an End User using the Services under a School-Created
    User Account, this section does not apply to you because we do not act as a
    business with or for individual End Users. In these instances, as explained
    in more detail in section 2 above, the privacy and security policies of your
    School govern your personal information and your rights. Even though this
    section does not apply to individual End Users, below we have included the
    categories of personal information that might be collected at the direction
    of your School. Not all categories will be collected or received for every
    End User. We are providing this extra information as a courtesy and for
    information purposes only, and it does not change our obligations under the
    CCPA. As explained in section 2 above, personal information of End Users is
    under the direct control of the School, and we only collect End User
    personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide the Services
    requested by the Client.
</p>
<p>
    As explained above, we collect limited personal information about individual
    Users with whom we have a direct “business” relationship. Not all categories
    will be collected or received for every individual. Under these
    circumstances, we may collect or receive (and may have collected or received
    during the 12-month period prior to the effective date of this Privacy
    Policy) the following categories of personal information:

            >Mobile messaging vendors who enable the delivery of mobile
            messages</em
        >. We may use and disclose personal information with third parties to
        enable and transmit SMS/MMS/Mobile messages via the Services.

    <li>
        <em
            >Voice/VOIP and other audible messaging vendors who enable the

        enable and transmit voice/VOIP and audible messages via the Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Third parties at your direction</em>. We may use and disclose
        personal information with third parties at your direction or with your
        consent (for example: third parties you choose to interact with via the
        Services).
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Third party analytics and performance vendors</em>. We may use and
        disclose personal information with third parties<em> </em>to measure and
        improve client engagement (for example: we use Google Analytics and
        Pendo to help us understand how our users use the Services).

    <li>
        <em>Third party security and technology vendors</em>. We may use and

        measures, billing, or technical support).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please also see section 3 above for more information about how we may
    disclose personal information. We may in some instances disclose personal
    information with third parties for other purposes than what is set out in
    the table above (for example: in connection with our corporate business
    purposes or for legal purposes).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we do not sell or otherwise attempt to monetize your
    personal information with third parties. However, under the CCPA, some of
    our activities may be considered “sales” of information or cross-context
    behavioral advertising . For example, we may disclose “identifiers” (see
    above) with our third party business partners, or use tracking technologies
    as described above, to help us promote Apptegy and our Services to Users
    that are Visitors. We do not promote Apptegy or our Services through
    cross-context behavioral advertising to End Users and School-Created User
    Accounts (for example: students, parents, and guardians).
</p>
<p>
    Please note that, as stated above, we will not sell or share personal
    information about individual consumers under the age of legal majority for
    the purpose of commercial marketing or targeted advertising. For more
    information about our practices and policies for children’s personal
    information, please see section 8 below and our Terms.

<p>
    For more information about our California Student Privacy Certification for
    practices relating to the personal information of children, please see

</p>
<p>
    We keep the personal information we collect about you for as long as is
    needed and appropriate for your use of the Services as set out in our Terms
    and this Privacy Policy. We dispose of the information we collect in
    accordance with our data retention policies and procedures. Please see
    section 9 below for more information.
</p>
<p>
    If you are a qualifying California resident under CCPA, we provide the
    following rights with respect to your personal information when we act as a
    “business” with or for you (subject to certain limitations in the CCPA):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Right to know</em>. Upon verifiable request we will provide you with
        the following information about your personal information over the prior
        12 months: (1) the specific pieces and categories of personal
        information we have collected about you; (2) the categories of sources
        from which we have collected your personal information; (3) our business
        purposes for collecting, selling, and sharing your personal information;
        (4) the categories of third parties with which we have shared your
        personal information; (5) the categories of personal information we have
        disclosed about you for a business purpose; and (6) if applicable,
        categories of personal information we have sold or shared about you, and
        the categories of third parties to which the personal information was
        sold or shared, for cross-context behavioral advertising.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Right to delete</em>. Upon verifiable request we will delete
        personal information we have collected about you and will direct our
        service providers to do the same, subject to certain exceptions in the
        CCPA.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em
            >Right to opt out of sales and sharing to third parties for
            cross-context behavioral advertising</em
        >. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
        Notwithstanding that, you have the right to direct us to not sell or
        share your personal information to third parties for cross-context
        behavioral advertising. In addition, we have provided our users with a
        link to submit this request, found here:
        www.apptegy.com/donotsellmypersonalinformation. Please note that if you
        are not logged into an account when you submit an opt-out request, your
        request will only be associated with the that browser. Please also note
        that if you opt-out from cross-context behavioral advertising, you may
        still receive ads about Apptegy but they will not be tailored to you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Right to correct</em>. Upon verifiable request we will correct any
        personal information that we have collected about you that is incorrect.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information</em>. We
        do not collect sensitive personal information. Notwithstanding that, you
        have the right to limit our use and disclosure of sensitive personal
        information to certain purposes in accordance with the CCPA.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em
            >Right to not be subject to discrimination for enforcing your CCPA
            rights</em
        >. You will not be discriminated against by us for your exercise of CCPA
        rights. We will not refuse the Services, change pricing, or provide a
        different quality of Services because of your exercise of CCPA rights.
        However, please note that in some instances, exercising certain CCPA
        rights may cause us to be unable to provide you with our Services
        because certain parts of the Services require personal information to
        function.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please note, as explained above at the beginning of section 5 and in section
    2.A, this section does not apply to you if you use our Services as an End
    User with a School-Created User Account or under an account of a School. In
    these instances, please contact your School about your personal information
    and your rights.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we will need to verify your identity before processing CCPA
    and other California requests, which may require us to request and obtain
    additional information from you. To do so, we may ask that you provide us
    with your first name, middle name, last name, email address, phone number,
    and address. We may also ask you to provide answers to questions about
    yourself to help verify your identity. We may also use or rely on
    third-party identity services to help us with identification verification
    and defend against fraudulent requests. We will use that information only to
    review and address your requests. We reserve the right to decline or limit
    requests in certain circumstances – for example, when we are unable to
    verify your identity or locate information in our systems, or when you have
    previously made two CCPA requests in the prior 12 months, or as otherwise
    permitted by applicable law.
</p>
<p>
    You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized
    agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your CCPA and other
    California rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will
    require the agent to provide us with proof that you have authorized it to
    act on your behalf, and we may also need you to verify your identity
    directly with us.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that we will also comply with valid requests from California
    residents that have an established business relationship with us under
    California’s “Shine the Light” law.
</p>
<p>
    We do not provide financial incentives related to the collection, use, or
    disclosure of personal information.

    If you are an individual resident of the European Union or the United
    Kingdom, you have certain rights with respect to your personal information,

    Please note that we will comply with valid requests from residents of the
    European Union and the United Kingdom subject to relevant legal exemptions.
    Please also note that we will need to verify your identity before processing
    any such requests, which may require us to request and obtain additional
    information from you. We will use that information only to review and
    address your requests. We reserve the right to decline or limit requests in
    certain circumstances – for example, when we are unable to verify your
    identity or locate information in our systems, or as otherwise permitted by
    applicable law.
</p>
<p>
    You may designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized
    agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights under this
    section. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the

    School about your personal information and your rights. Otherwise, if you
    have questions, or would like to exercise any of your rights under the GDPR,

<p><strong>7. CANADIAN RESIDENTS</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Canadian resident, this section applies to you.</p>
<p>
    Consent: By submitting personal information to us, or our service providers
    and agents, you consent to the collection use, disclosure, and transfer of
    your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and as
    permitted or required by law. You may withdraw your consent at any time to
    the collection, use, disclosure, or transfer of your personal information
    time by contacting us at privacy@apptegy.com. If you withdraw your consent
    (or if you decide not to provide certain personal information), you
    acknowledge that we may not be able to provide you, or continue to provide
    you, with certain products, services, or information that may be of value to
    you.
</p>
<p>
    Retention of Personal Information: The personal information that you provide
    will be retained by us in accordance with applicable laws. However, we will
    take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal
    information we hold if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it
    was collected.
</p>
<p>
    Access and Correction: We will take reasonable steps to ensure the personal
    information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Upon your written
    request, and subject to certain exceptions provided by law, we will inform
    you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and
    give you access to that information. We may charge a minimal fee for
    providing such access to you. If you believe that the personal information
    that we hold about you is not accurate or complete, you may write to us at
    <a href="privacy@apptegy.com">privacy@apptegy.com</a>. If you are able to
    establish that the information is not accurate or complete, we will take
    reasonable steps to delete and/or correct the information so that it is
    accurate, complete, and up-to-date. In order to facilitate a request to
    correct or update information, we may ask you to provide additional
    information to confirm your identity. Any such information will only be used
    for the purpose of confirming your identity and will not be retained by us.

<p><strong>8. CHILDREN’S AND STUDENT DATA PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>
    Protecting children’s and students’ privacy is especially important to us.
    We participate in the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor program. We have been
    granted the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor seal signifying that our Site and
    Thrillshare, as well as the software that runs the Site and Thrillshare,
    have been reviewed and approved for having policies and practices
    surrounding the collection, use, maintenance, and disclosure of personal
    information from children consistent with the iKeepSafe COPPA Safe Harbor
    program guidelines. COPPA protects the online privacy of Children under the
    age of 13.
</p>
<p>
    We also participate in the iKeepSafe FERPA Certification and California
    Student Privacy Certification programs. We have been granted the iKeepSafe
    FERPA Certified seal and the California Student Privacy Certification seal
    signifying that our Site and Thrillshare, as well as the software that runs
    the Site and Thrillshare, have been reviewed and approved for having
    policies and practices surrounding the collection, use, maintenance, and
    disclosure of personal information from children consistent with the
    iKeepSafe FERPA Certification and California Student Privacy Certification
    program guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    For additional information please visit
    https://ikeepsafe.org/certifications/ or email IKeepSafe Safe Harbor program
    at privacy@ikeepsafe.org.
</p>
<p>
    We do not intentionally request, collect, store, or use personal information
    from or about any child under the age of legal majority for our own use. We
    only request, collect, store, and use personal information about children as
    is necessary to provide the Services to our Clients and Users, and only as
    requested by the Client, as explained more fully in this Policy and in our
    Terms of Use. If we learn that we have unintentionally collected personal
    information from or about a child other than as set out in this Policy and
    in our Terms of Use, we will delete that information as soon as reasonably
    practicable. Please see our Terms of Use for more information about the
    limited circumstances when children may use the Services.
</p>
<p>
    As explained above, our Clients are often Schools. In providing the Services
    to Schools we may receive student data from or about children as a necessary
    part of providing the Services to the Client. We may receive student data
    from a School directly (for example: student data about the students
    attending the School) or from End Users using our Services under a
    School-Created User Account (for example: a teacher, student, parent, or
    guardian using the Services set up by their School). The student data we
    receive may include educational records and other personal information about
    students. When we receive student data in connection with providing the
    Services for a Client, we collect, use, and maintain it under the direct
    control of the Client and only as is necessary to provide the Services
    requested by the Client and its End Users. Apptegy does not disclose student
    information to third parties except as reasonably necessary to support the
    internal operations of the Services, as further set out in Section 3 above.
</p>
<p>
    Please see Section 2.A above (Personal Information from Schools and Under
    School Accounts) for more information about student information provided by
    and collected from Schools and End Users using Services under a School
    account, including children under the age of 13.
</p>
<p>
    If you are an End User using the Services under a Client account (for
    example: a student, parent, or guardian using a School-Created User
    Account), and you have questions or requests about the personal information
    of a student or want to review the personal information of a student that
    has been collected by Apptegy, please contact your School directly.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy respects and values the privacy of student data, and we work hard to
    protect it. When a law or regulation creates direct obligations for Apptegy
    about student data privacy, we comply with it. For example, Apptegy
    collects, uses, and maintains student data in accordance with the Family
    Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“<strong>FERPA</strong>”) and the
    Children’s Online Privacy and Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”), and
    only as is set out in this Policy and the Terms of Use. When a law or
    regulation creates obligations for a Client about student data privacy, we
    work with the Client to allow the Client to comply. For example, through the
    Services, Apptegy collects, uses, and maintains student data under the
    direct control of the Client as is required under FERPA.
</p>
<p>
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Apptegy relies on the
    Client to obtain the required legal consents from End Users invited or added
    to the Services by the Client, including parents, guardians, and students.
    Our Clients consent, as agents for and on behalf of the children, parents,
    and guardians invited or added to the Services by the Client, to Apptegy’s
    collection, use, and storage of personal information about or from the
    children. We rely on our Clients’ consent per the previous sentence for the
    purposes of complying with COPPA, and we are authorized to presume that
    Clients have obtained and will maintain all<strong> </strong>required parent
    or guardian consent for Apptegy’s collection, use, and disclosure of
    information for any children under the age of thirteen (13) that are invited
    or added to the Services under Client accounts. This is because, as
    explained above, our Clients are the Schools; we do not have direct
    relationships with individual End Users of the Services. As such, if you are
    a School and invite or add children to use the Services under your Client
    account, or if you allow the End Users under your account to provide
    personal information for or about children, you represent and warrant that
    you are consenting as agents for and on behalf of your End Users (as set out
    above) or have obtained and will maintain all required consents from
    students, parents, and guardians, as applicable, for Apptegy’s collection,
    use, and storage of personal information from or about any children under
    your account, including children under the age of thirteen (13).
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE NOTE that some or all of the information we collect about or from End
    Users may not be private as to the individual User. For example, for Users
    of Rooms, information shared by a User via a message feature of Rooms will
    be visible to Client, as the party providing access to the Services to its
    Users. In some circumstances, information provided by or about a child may
    be available or visible to other individual Users. For example, for Users of
    Rooms, information about a child that is posted in the group messaging tool
    in a child’s Room may be visible to other individual Users that are also
    authorized users for the same Room. Apptegy will collect, use, and disclose
    such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms.
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE NOTE while many parts of the Services do not require personal
    information to function as intended, and we will not collect more personal
    information than is reasonably necessary to support the internal operations
    of the Services, we encourage parents and guardians to monitor their child’s
    use of the Services, particularly Rooms, and to assist us by instructing
    them to never provide personal information on the Services, particularly
    including Rooms, without your permission.
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE NOTE that if you discover or are made aware of any activity or
    information on the Services that is or may be connected to the abduction or
    sexual exploitation of a child, you should contact law enforcement
    authorities immediately. Please see the National Center for Missing and
    Exploited Children (NCMEC) (<a
        href="http://www.missingkids.org/education?ref=apptegy.com"
        >www.missingkids.org/education</a
    >) for more information and resources related to abduction and child sexual
    exploitation prevention.
</p>
<p>
    As discussed above, we may use and disclose personal information with and to
    third parties when it is necessary to provide the Services or for our
    business. For a list of third parties with whom we share student data or
    child personal information, please contact us by email at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@apptegy.com">privacy@apptegy.com</a> or visit
    www.apptegy.com/privacy-policy/service-providers.
</p>
<p><strong>9. SECURITY OF INFORMATION; DATA TRANSFERS AND RETENTION</strong></p>
<p>
    Personal information is very important to us, and we continuously work to
    keep it secure and to improve our practices. We maintain administrative,
    technical, and physical controls and practices that we believe are
    reasonable to safeguard against the unauthorized access and use of personal
    information. For example, we conduct periodic system evaluations, maintain
    system and security certifications, manage and log system access, and
    perform and maintain regular backups. We use industry-accepted encryption
    practices to protect personal information during transfer and at rest. Our
    employees and contract personnel receive privacy and security training, and
    are bound by our personal information policies. Finally, we work to stay
    informed about industry requirements and changing standards. Notwithstanding
    the foregoing, we cannot and do not guarantee the total security of your
    information in all circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    If we become aware of a security incident, we will comply with applicable
    law. We will notify impacted Clients of verified security incidents as soon
    as practicable, and respond to them, in accordance with your Client
    Agreement (as defined in the Terms of Use) and applicable law. If you are an
    impacted End User (for example: a teacher, staff, student, parent, or
    guardian added to the Services by a School), we will notify you of verified
    security incidents, and respond to them, in accordance with the instructions
    of the Client that added you to the Services (for example: the School that
    is your employer or that you attend as a student) and applicable law. If you
    are an impacted Visitor and you do not use the Services as an End User (for
    example: an individual browsing a public part of the Sites that does not
    require a log-in or an invitation from a Client), we will notify you of
    verified security incidents, and respond to them, in accordance with
    applicable law.
</p>
<p>
    We are based in the United States. Your information will be accessed,
    transferred, processed, and stored in the United States. We also have
    offices and personnel in locations outside of the United States, including
    Mexico. In some circumstances your information may be accessed, transferred,
    processed, or stored outside of the United States when that is reasonably
    necessary to provide, operate, or maintain the Services (for example: to
    process information updates for School-Created User Accounts; or to provide
    maintenance and support for parts of the Services). We maintain
    administrative, technical, and physical controls and practices that we
    believe are reasonable to safeguard the access, transfer, processing, and
    storage of personal information in and to all locations where we do
    business. By using the Services, or providing us with any information, you
    are consenting to the access, transfer, processing, and storage of your
    information, including personal information, in the United States and in the
    other locations where we do business.
</p>
<p>
    How we retain and delete personal information from or about you depends on
    our relationship with you. Specifically:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are a Client (for example: a School), we will retain and delete
        personal information we collect from or about you and your End Users
        according to your instructions, and in accordance with your Client
        Agreement (as defined in the Terms of Use) and applicable law. When you
        are no longer a Client (for example: if your Client Agreement ends), we
        will delete personal information associated with your Client account in
        accordance with your Client Agreement and applicable law, and as soon as
        reasonably practicable after the termination of your Client
        relationship. If you are a Client and have questions or requests about
        retaining or deleting personal information associated with your Client
        account, please contact us by any of the methods set out below in the
        section 10 titled “Contact Us”; or
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are an End User (for example: a teacher, staff, student, parent,

    incorporates or is made available by a third party, you will also be subject
    to the third party practices and policies associated with the third party
    services that you use.
