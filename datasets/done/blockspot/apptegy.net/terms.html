    <strong>NOTICE</strong>: We have updated our Terms of Use effective May 31,
    2023. We did this primarily (1) to notify Users about our COPPA, FERPA, and
    California Student Privacy certifications issued by iKeepSafe (please see
    below for more information); (2) to create more consistency in how we
    explain our student data practices across these Terms, our Privacy Policy,
    and our Client Agreements; and (3) to add language about new laws that may
    apply to you. We believe the rights and obligations of Users and Apptegy did
    not materially change as a result of this update. However, we encourage you
    to review the updated Terms of Use below, which applies to all Users of the
    Services on a going-forward basis.

        any of the foregoing
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (collectively, including the Sites, Thrillshare, Media, Engage, Rooms, and
    all services related to the foregoing, the “<strong>Services</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    These Terms apply to you and all other Users of the Services.
    “<strong>Users</strong>” include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clients (as defined below);</li>
    <li>End Users (as defined below); and</li>
    <li>Visitors (as defined below).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    For the sake of clarity, references to “<strong>Users</strong>” and

</p>
<p>
    PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. We have attempted to provide
    transparent explanations of our practices and policies so you can make a
    meaningful decision about whether to use the Services.
</p>
<p>
    BY USING THE SERVICES IN ANY WAY, INCLUDING USING THE SERVICES AS AN END
    USER OR ONLY AS A VISITOR, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EVERYTHING IN THESE
    TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS IN FULL, YOU MAY NOT USE THE
    SERVICES AND YOU SHOULD STOP USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY.

<p>
    <strong
        >IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT INTEGRATION WITH SEPARATE CLIENT
        AGREEMENTS</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    Some Users have a direct business relationship with us (individually, a
    “<strong>Client</strong>” and collectively, “<strong>Clients</strong>”). Our
    Clients are typically education institutions, government bodies, and other
    organizations. Clients execute a separate order form and client agreement
    with us that includes additional terms and conditions for the Services and
    for our business relationship (a “<strong>Client Agreement</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
    If you are a User and also a Client, the terms and conditions of our Client
    Agreement are in addition to these Terms; <em>provided </em>you are also
    subject to these Terms as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the terms and conditions of the Client Agreement will control and govern
        with respect to all matters expressly addressed in the Client Agreement;
        and
    </li>
    <li>
        the terms and conditions of these Terms will control and govern with
        respect to all matters not expressly addressed in the Client Agreement.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Not all Users are Clients. Most individuals that access or use the Services
    are invited or added to the Services by a Client under the Client’s account
    with us (for example: teachers, students, parents, and guardians invited or
    added to the Services by their education institution). Some individuals only
    visit the public parts of the Services that do not require a log-in or an
    invitation from a Client (for example: individuals browsing the Sites). In
    these terms we call individual end users using the Services under a Client
    account “<strong>End Users</strong>” and call individual visitors to the
    public parts of the Services “<strong>Visitors</strong>.” All individual
    Users are either End Users or Visitors.
</p>
<p>
    We do not offer or provide Client accounts for individuals, including End
    Users or Visitors. This means that End Users and Visitors are not Clients
    and will not have a Client Agreement separate from these Terms. If you are a
    User without a Client Agreement, including End Users and Visitors, these
    Terms will control and govern in all circumstances.
</p>
<p><strong>1. Summary of the Terms</strong></p>
<p>
    The Services are communication and group management tools. Apptegy provides
    the Services for you to use in your sole discretion and at your own risk,
    except as expressly set out in these Terms. You are exclusively responsible
    and liable for your use of the Services and for any consequence of your use
    of the Services to you and to all third parties. Apptegy does not
    participate in, is not a party to, and is not liable for the activities of
    Users on or through the Services. More information is available below.
</p>
<p>
    We collect, store, and use personal information in the ways we explain below
    and in our Privacy Policy. Apptegy respects and values the privacy of
    personal information, and we work hard to protect it. We have attempted to
    provide transparent explanations of our privacy practices and policies so
    you can make a meaningful decision about whether to use the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy works hard to keep your personal information secure. That said, no
    technology company can guarantee absolute data security. For more
    information about our security practices, please continue to read below and
    review our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    We rely on third party providers for parts of the Services. The parts of the
    Services that rely on or implement third party products or services may also
    be subject to the practices and policies of the applicable third party
    provider, which may be different than ours. More information is available
    below and in our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    By using the Services, you agree that Apptegy will not be responsible or
    liable to you or any third party for any consequence, loss, or damage
    arising (directly or indirectly) from or relating to your use of the
    Services, unless and only as specifically described otherwise in these
    Terms. More information is available below.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal Information and Privacy Generally</strong></p>
<p>
    By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that Apptegy collects,
    stores, and uses certain personal information about Users. To understand
    what personal information we collect, store, and use, please review our
    Privacy Policy:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.apptegy.com/privacy-policy/"
            >https://www.apptegy.com/privacy-policy/</a
        >.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The Privacy Policy applies to all Users and for all Services generally. By
    using the Services in any way, you understand and acknowledge that the terms
    of our Privacy Policy apply to you in all circumstances. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client Agreement will
    control and govern with respect to all matters expressly addressed in the
    Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ from those set
    out in this section.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Children’s Personal Information and Privacy</strong></p>
<p>
    Apptegy does not intentionally request, collect, store, or use personal
    information from or about any child under the age of legal majority for our
    own purposes. Instead, we prohibit use of the Services by children under the
    age of legal majority, including children under the age of thirteen (13),
    unless and only to the extent the child is a User invited or added to the
    Services by a Client. When children are invited or added to the Services as
    Users under Client’s account (for example: students attending the
    educational institution that is the Client), Apptegy provides the Services
    with respect to the students solely in the educational context authorized by
    Client under that Client’s Client Agreement, and solely for the benefit of
    the Client and its Users. We only request, collect, store, and use personal
    information about children as is necessary to provide the Services to our
    Clients and Users, and only as directed by the Client, as explained more
    fully below and in our Privacy Policy. If we learn that we have
    unintentionally collected personal information from or about a child other
    than as set out below and in our Privacy Policy, we will delete that
    information as soon as reasonably practicable.
</p>
<p>
    When children are invited or added to the Services as Users under Client’s
    account, Apptegy may receive and collect information from or about children
    as a necessary part of providing the Services to the Client (for example, as
    applicable: contact information for communications sent via the Services;
    posts made on messaging tools in the Services; information included in
    assignments and other class content submitted via the Services). These Terms
    and our Privacy Policy, accessible as set out above, provide notice
    regarding Apptegy’s collection, use, and disclosure of personal information
    from children. Please see the Privacy Policy for more detailed information,
    specifically including Section 8 of the Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    Please see our Privacy Policy for information about our Children’s Online
    Privacy and Protection Act (“<strong>COPPA</strong>”) and Family Educational
    Rights and Privacy Act (“<strong>FERPA</strong>”) practices and policies.
</p>
<p><strong>4. User Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>
    To use the Services, you must be a Client, an End User invited or added to
    the Services by a Client, or a Visitor. By using the Services, you represent
    that you are one of these types of Users. Any use of or attempt to use the
    Services in any other capacity is void.
</p>
<p>
    When you use the Services, Apptegy grants you a limited, personal,
    revocable, non-transferable, and non-exclusive license to use the Services
    subject to these Terms. This limited license is only so you may use the
    Services as allowed under these Terms, solely for your internal purposes if
    you are a Client and solely for your personal purposes if you are an End
    User or Visitor. You may not use the Services for any Prohibited Use or
    Content (as defined below). This license is revocable at will and may be
    terminated by Apptegy without notice to you.
</p>
<p>
    Parts of the Services require you to register for, or access and use the
    Services under, an account. Clients have Client accounts. End Users have End
    User accounts. Visitors are not permitted to create an account. We request
    certain account information from or about Clients and End Users to provide
    the Services. You agree to provide truthful and complete information for and
    in connection with your account. If you choose to not provide certain
    account information or fail to complete account information requests, parts
    of the Services may not be available to you or may not function as intended.
    We treat personal information you provide in connection with your account in
    accordance with our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    Clients may manage their account via the Services or by contacting us. End
    User accounts are created, controlled, and managed by the Client that
    invited or added you to the Services (for example: the educational
    institution that is your employer or that you attend as a student). If you
    are an End User, your Client account administrator(s) may be able to manage,
    access, change, edit, disable, or deactivate your account, your account
    information, or your log-in credentials without our or your involvement or
    consent. End Users that want to manage, access, change, edit, disable, or
    deactivate their account, account information, or log-in credentials must
    contact the Client that invited or added them to the Services (for example:
    the educational institution that is your employer or that you attend as a
    student). End Users are also subject to the account practices and policies
    of the applicable Client. The Client’s practices and policies may be
    materially different than our practices and policies. Apptegy expressly
    disclaims all liability for the foregoing.
</p>
<p>
    Use of the Services by individuals under the age of legal majority in their
    jurisdiction of residence is expressly prohibited, unless and only to the
    extent the individual is an End User invited or added to the Services by a
    Client (for example: a student using the Services set up by their education
    institution). If you are an individual User under the age of legal majority
    in your jurisdiction of residence, a parent or legal guardian must agree to
    these Terms on your behalf and consent to your use of the Services, and that
    parent or legal guardian will be exclusively responsible and liable for your
    use of the Services and for any consequence of your use of the Services. Any
    attempt by an individual under the age of legal majority in their
    jurisdiction to use the Services in any capacity without the agreement and
    consent of a parent or guardian is void. For all End Users under the age of
    legal majority in their jurisdiction of residence, Apptegy exclusively
    relies on the Client to obtain the required legal consents from a parent or
    legal guardian. Please see Section 3 above and our Privacy Policy for more
    information about use of the Services by Users under the age of legal
    majority.
</p>
<p>
    If you are using the Services as or on behalf of an individual other than
    yourself, you represent that you are authorized and have express prior
    consent to act for and bind that other person to these Terms. If you are
    using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are
    authorized and have express prior consent to act for and bind that entity to
    these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy reserves the right to determine in our sole discretion whether your
    access or use of the Services fails to satisfy the terms of this Section 4.
    Failure to comply with the terms set out in this section will be a breach of
    these Terms and may result in termination of your use of the Services and
    liability for damages. You agree that Apptegy will not be liable, and you
    will indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse Apptegy for any consequence,
    loss, damage, or expense (direct or indirect) (including attorneys’ fees and
    settlement amounts) arising from or relating to your failure to comply with
    the terms set out in this section.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.

        permitted by these Terms;

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You are solely responsible and liable for all activity that occurs on and
    through the Services under or in connection with your account. THIS
    SPECIFICALLY INCLUDES ALL CONTENT AND COMMUNICATIONS POSTED, UPLOADED,
    SHARED, OR OTHERWISE PROVIDED ON OR VIA THE SERVICES UNDER OR IN CONNECTION
    WITH YOUR ACCOUNT, AND ANY CONSEQUENCE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE (DIRECT OR INDIRECT)
    CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO THE FOREGOING.
</p>
<p>
    You must actively monitor the use of the Services under or in association
    with your account. You are solely responsible and liable for maintaining and
    safeguarding the security and accuracy of your account, as well as ensuring
    that all use of the Services by you or in connection with your account does
    not violate these Terms. You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized
    access or use.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy does not, as a general rule, actively monitor the actions of
    individual Users on or via the Services, but we reserve the right to do so
    at any time and for any reason. Apptegy expressly disclaims all liability
    for the foregoing. YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy is not responsible or liable for the actions or omissions of any
    User on or via the Services, or any consequence thereof. THIS SPECIFICALLY
    INCLUDES ALL CONTENT AND COMMUNICATIONS POSTED, UPLOADED, SHARED, OR

<p>
    Apptegy reserves the right to determine in our sole discretion whether your
    access or use of the Services fails to satisfy the terms of this Section 5.
    Failure to comply with the terms set out in this section will be a breach of
    these Terms and may result in termination of your use of the Services and

    will indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse Apptegy for any consequence,
    loss, damage, or expense (direct or indirect) (including attorneys’ fees and

</p>
<p><strong>6. Our Rights as Apptegy</strong></p>
<p>
    Apptegy exclusively owns and holds all rights, title, and interests in and
    to the Services and all intellectual property rights arising from or related
    to the Services. Users do not acquire any such rights by using the Services.
    The Services are currently (or may be in the future) protected by copyright,
    trademark, patents, trade secrets, and other laws of both the United States
    and foreign countries. Other than as expressly provided in these Terms, you
    do not have any right to use, copy, or imitate the name “Apptegy” or any of
    the Apptegy trademarks, logos, domain names, distinctive brand features, or
    other intellectual property or content, in whole or in part, without our
    prior written permission.
</p>
<p>
    By using the Services, you grant Apptegy a non-exclusive, limited, revocable
    license during the term to upload, use, copy, store, transmit, and display
    all information, content, communications, posts, publications, and other
    material stored or uploaded by you and under or in association with your
    account (collectively, “<strong>User Content</strong>”) to the extent
    necessary to provide the Services to you. All rights, title, and interests
    in and to User Content will remain exclusively with the applicable User;
    <em>provided</em> that Apptegy is permitted to aggregate and use generalized
    and deidentified User Content for any purpose in our sole discretion in
    accordance with our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    If you are an End User of the Services under a Client account, you
    acknowledge that your individual rights with respect to User Content will
    also be subject to the practices and policies of the applicable Client (for
    example: the educational institution that is your employer or that you
    attend as a student). The Client’s practices and policies may be materially
    different than our practices and policies. Apptegy expressly disclaims all
    liability for the foregoing.
</p>
<p>
    We reserve the right to terminate, suspend, change, or refuse to provide all
    or any part of the Services, to restrict or limit use of all or any part of
    the Services, to suspend or terminate any User, and to change eligibility
    criteria for Users – all at any time and for any reason in our sole
    discretion, and without notice or liability to you.
</p>
<p>
    Feedback, ideas, and suggestions you provide (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”)
    about Apptegy or the Services is welcome and is entirely voluntary. You
    grant Apptegy an exclusive, unlimited, unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable,
    worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license to use all Feedback in our
    sole discretion, including for modifying the Services and for other
    commercial uses. This license includes all intellectual property rights in
    and to all Feedback. By providing Feedback, you agree that our right to use
    Feedback is without restriction and solely in our discretion.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p><strong>7. Support Services</strong></p>
<p>
    We will respond to all questions about or relating to the Services within a
    reasonable period of time during normal business hours. We will use
    commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are accessible
    24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and to minimize the amount of time the
    Services are unavailable. We are not responsible for Users’ internet
    connections or equipment. You acknowledge and agree that from time to time
    the Services may be inaccessible or inoperable.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Confidential Information; Disclosure of User Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You and Apptegy each agree to keep confidential and to not disclose to any
    third party the non-public confidential and/or proprietary information of
    the other party, and to only use such information as required in connection
    with the Services or as expressly permitted by these Terms. Breach of the
    foregoing obligation will cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages
    would be inadequate. If a breach occurs or is threatened, the party from
    which the applicable information originated will be entitled to seek an
    injunction, a restraining order, or other equitable remedy, in addition to
    all other available remedies. That party will not need to post a bond or
    other security or provide proof of actual damages.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy will seek to protect User information from disclosure in most
    instances as a general policy. However, we reserve the right in our
    discretion to access, read, preserve, and disclose User information that we
    reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law,
    regulation, legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce these
    Terms, including investigation or prosecution of potential violations or
    abuse; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or
    technical issues; (iv) respond to User support requests; (v) comply with any
    lawful requests for information from the Client that has paid for or is
    otherwise providing your access to the Services; and (vi) protect the
    rights, property, or safety of Apptegy, our Users, or the public.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p>Please see our Privacy Policy for additional information.</p>
<p><strong>9. Termination</strong></p>
<p>
    These Terms apply to you until your use of the Services is terminated. If
    you are a Client, you may terminate your use of the Services in accordance
    with your Client Agreement. If you are an End User, you may terminate your
    use of the Services at any time in your discretion, however your End User
    account may be terminated only by the Client that invited or added you to
    the Services (for example: the educational institution that is your employer
    or that you attend as a student). If you are a Visitor, you may terminate
    your use of the Services in your discretion. Apptegy reserves the right to
    terminate all or any part of the Services and to terminate any User at any
    time and for any reason in our sole discretion, and without notice or
    liability to you. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, examples
    of when Apptegy may terminate your use of the Services include (i) when you
    have violated these Terms, the Privacy Policy, a Client Agreement, or other
    published policies; (ii) when you create risk of or possible legal exposure
    for Apptegy; or (iii) when the Services are no longer commercially viable.
</p>
<p>
    In all such cases, your license to use the Services will automatically be
    canceled, except that the following sections will continue to apply: 2, 3,
    5, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12, as well as any other provision that would logically
    survive termination or expiration.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.

    >
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY</strong>. This section limits the
    liability of Apptegy and its past, present, and future parents,
    subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees,
    agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “<strong

        >BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS
        SECTION</strong
    >. Each subsection below applies to the maximum extent permitted under
    applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain
    warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and, as a result,
    the contents of these sections may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10, for Users with
    a Client Agreement, the Client Agreement will control and govern with
    respect to all matters expressly addressed in the Client Agreement, and
    those terms and conditions may differ from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong
        >A. Use is at Your Own Risk; The Services are Available “AS-IS”</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy has no fiduciary or other special relationship with you. YOUR ACCESS
    TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. You understand and agree
    that the Services are provided to you on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”
    basis.
</p>
<p>
    To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, except as expressly
    set out in these Terms, THE APPTEGY ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES,
    WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, SECURITY, ACCURACY, AND ANY WARRANTIES
    IMPLIED BY PERFORMANCE OR USE. APPTEGY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES
    ARE ERROR-FREE. THE SERVICES MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE, INTERRUPTED, OR
    DELAYED FOR VARIOUS REASONS (INCLUDING MAINTENANCE AND INTERRUPTIONS
    INHERENT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INTERNET AND THIRD PARTY MESSAGING
    SYSTEMS).
</p>
<p>
    Except as is expressly set out in these Terms and the Privacy Policy, the
    Apptegy Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and
    liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness,
    security, and reliability of the Services; (ii) any harm that results from
    your access to or use of the Services; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure
    to store or to transmit, any information and other communications maintained
    by the Services; (iv) whether the Services meet your requirements or are
    available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis; and (v) any
    third party claims, consequence, loss, or damage (direct or indirect)
    arising in any way out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms.
    No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Apptegy
    Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly
    made in these Terms.
</p>
<p>
    IT IS THE EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH USER TO EVALUATE THE RISK,
    ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, DEPENDABILITY, USEFULNESS, AND MARKETABILITY OF THE
    SERVICES, AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES OR
    OBTAINED FROM ANOTHER USER, THIRD PARTY, OR LINKED SITE.
</p>
<p><strong>B. Third Party Links and Resources</strong></p>
<p>
    The Services may contain links to third party products, websites, and
    resources. Except as expressly set out in the Services, you agree that the
    Apptegy Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or
    accuracy of third party products, websites, or resources; (ii) the content,
    products, or services on or available from third party websites or
    resources; and (iii) any consequence, loss or damage (direct or indirect)
    arising from third party products, websites, or resources. Inclusion of
    third party products, websites, or resources does not imply endorsement by
    the Apptegy Entities of the websites, resources, or the content, products,
    or services available from the third parties. You acknowledge sole
    responsibility for and assume all risk of your use of any third party
    product, website, or resource.
</p>
<p><strong>C. Third Party Providers and Partners</strong></p>
<p>
    Apptegy relies on third party providers and partners for parts of the
    Services (for example: posting a communication on a Facebook or Twitter
    account; or language translations). Apptegy may also engage third parties to
    perform certain Services. Except as expressly set out on in these Terms or
    the Privacy Policy, you agree that the Apptegy Entities are not responsible
    or liable for: (i) the availability, functionality, or accuracy of the parts
    of the Services provided by third party providers and partners; (ii) any
    interruption, delay, suspension, or termination of the Services as a result
    of third party providers and partners; and (iii) any consequence, loss, or
    damage (direct or indirect) arising from or relating to third party
    providers and partners. On written request by a User, Apptegy will provide
    within a reasonable time a list of the non-confidential third party
    providers and partners that Apptegy uses for the Services at that time.
</p>
<p>
    If you register for or log on to the Services by using existing third party
    accounts or profiles (for example: login via Google, Facebook, Twitter,
    etc.) and/or use third party services accessible via the Services (for
    example: posting a communication on a Facebook or Twitter account), you
    agree that you will also be subject to the third party practices and
    policies associated with the third party services that you use. The
    practices and policies of the applicable third parties may be materially
    different than our practices and policies, including with respect to data
    privacy and security. YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF THIRD PARTY SERVICES IS AT YOUR
    OWN RISK.
</p>
<p>
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, YOU AGREE THAT APPTEGY IS
    NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENCE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE (DIRECT OR INDIRECT)
    ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE PARTS OF THE SERVICES MANAGED OR MADE
    AVAILABLE BY OR VIA THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS, AND/OR YOUR USE OF
    THE SAME.
</p>
<p>Please see our Privacy Policy for more information.</p>
<p><strong>D. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPTEGY ENTITIES WILL
    NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
    CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUE, USE,
    GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR
    INDIRECTLY BY YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
    APPTEGY ENTITIES WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY HARM, DAMAGES, OR
    LOSS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY
    TO ACCESS OR USE) THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY USER OR
    THIRD PARTY ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, AND DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL
    CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT
    VIEWED OR OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR
    ALTERATION OF THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE
    APPTEGY ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (U.S.
    $1,000.00) OR THE AMOUNT PAID TO APPTEGY BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES IN THE
    PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS. FOR FREE USES OR TRIAL USES, APPTEGY’S TOTAL
    LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). THE
    FOREGOING REMEDY WILL CONSTITUTE THE APPTEGY ENTITIES’ SOLE LIABILITY AND
    OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM BY YOU.
</p>
<p>
    THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION WILL APPLY TO ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY,
    WHETHER BASED ON PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
    STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, WHETHER OR NOT THE
    APPTEGY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE,
    AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET OUT IN THIS AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS
    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
</p>
<p>
    IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER
    CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 1542, WHICH STATES “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND
    TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER
    FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER
    MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”
</p>
<p><strong>E. Monitoring the Services</strong></p>
<p>
    As set out in these Terms, Clients and End Users (for example: teachers,
    students, parents, and guardians using the Services set up by their
    education institution) are solely responsible for all User information,
    content, and messages that are communicated or published via the Services
    (for example: communications published by an educational institution via
    Media, or communications and materials posted by a student or teacher via
    Rooms). It is possible that some User content may be inappropriate and/or
    constitute Prohibited Use or Content. You are solely responsible and liable
    for monitoring the Services to ensure that User content is not
    inappropriate. If you are an End User and discover inappropriate User
    content, you should promptly notify the Client that invited or added you to
    the Services (for example: the educational institution that is your employer
    or that you attend as a student). If you are a Client and discover or are
    made aware of inappropriate User content on or under your Client account,
    you should remove it promptly. If you are unable to remove it, please
    contact us and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to assist you.
    Apptegy does not, as a general rule, actively monitor the actions of
    individual Users on or via the Services, but we reserve the right to do so
    at any time and for any reason.
</p>
<p>
    Parts of the Services include features that allow Users to flag User content
    as inappropriate. When a User flags User content as inappropriate, the
    Client that is associated with the flagged User content receives notice (for
    example: the educational institution that is the Client). In all such
    events, the Client is exclusively responsible and liable for reviewing the
    flagged content, and exclusively responsible and liable for determining
    whether to remove or permit the flagged content, and whether any other
    action is necessary or appropriate. Please note that the content flagging
    feature may be disabled and will only be available to End Users if the
    Client that invited or added you to the Services (for example: the
    educational institution that is your employer or that you attend as a
    student) chooses to enable it.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy disclaims all responsibility and liability for the availability,
    completeness, timeliness, reliability, accuracy, and decision-making with
    respect to monitoring User actions and User content on the Services, and the
    review or non-review of flagged User content, as well as all harm, claims,
    consequences, losses, and damages (direct or indirect) arising in any way
    out of or related to all User content, flagged User content and the review
    or non-review thereof, and any action or non-action related to any of the
    foregoing. The Apptegy Entities will not be liable in any manner or form, or
    under any theory or cause of action, for inappropriate content or materials
    posted on or communicated via the Services, or any review or lack thereof of
    such content or materials, or any action or non-action related to any of the
    foregoing, unless Apptegy is the author of the content or materials. No
    advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Apptegy
    Entities or through the Services will create any liability or obligation for
    Apptegy with respect to User content that is not expressly made in these
    Terms.
</p>
<p>
    PLEASE NOTE that if you discover or are made aware of any User content that
    is or may be connected to the abduction or sexual exploitation of a child,
    you should contact law enforcement authorities immediately. Please see the
    National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)
    (www.missingkids.org/education) for more information and resources related
    to abduction and child sexual exploitation prevention.
</p>
<p><strong>F. Alerts</strong></p>
<p>
    If you purchase and/or use the alerts feature of the Services, you
    acknowledge and agree that we provide alerts functionality only as a
    non-emergency communication tool. You acknowledge and agree that the
    Services are not intended to be and cannot be used as a substitute for
    emergency communication methods (for example: contacting law enforcement
    and/or emergency medical professionals in the event of a threat to person or
    property; or providing notice of an emergency). Traditional emergency
    communications should be completed before using the Services in any such
    event. Clients and End Users, as applicable, are solely responsible and
    liable for use of the alerts feature and the completeness, timeliness,
    reliability, accuracy, omission, and decision-making with respect to all
    alerts content. You are solely responsible and liable for your own reliance
    on alerts or lack thereof, and all alert content.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy disclaims all responsibility and liability for the completeness,
    timeliness, reliability, content, accuracy, omission, and decision-making
    with respect to all alerts or lack thereof, and all harm, claims,
    consequences, losses, and damages (direct or indirect) arising in any way
    out of or related to all alerts or lack thereof. Apptegy Entities will not
    be liable in any manner or form, or under any theory or cause of action, for
    alerts or lack thereof, or alert content, posted on or communicated via the
    Services unless we post the content or materials. No advice or information,
    whether oral or written, obtained from the Apptegy Entities or through the
    Services will create any liability or obligation for Apptegy with respect to
    alerts or alert content that is not expressly made in these Terms.
</p>
<p><strong>G. Translations</strong></p>
<p>
    When using the Services, you may see or receive content that has been
    translated from English to another language, or vice versa. In those
    circumstances, the Services have been translated for your convenience only
    and may have been translated using third party translation software.
    Reasonable efforts have been made to provide an accurate translation;
    <em>however</em>, no translation is perfect, nor is automated translation
    intended to replace human translators. Translations are provided to you
    solely on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. No warranty of any kind,
    either express or implied, is made as to the accuracy, reliability, or
    correctness of any language translation. Some content (for example: images,
    videos, Flash, etc.) may not be accurately translated due to the limitations
    of translation software.
</p>
<p>
    The official text is the English version of the Services. Any discrepancies
    or differences created in translation are not binding and have no legal
    effect for compliance or enforcement purposes. If you have a question
    related to the information contained in translated Services, please refer to
    the official English version of the Services.
</p>
<p>
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Services may contain
    translations powered by Google Translate. Google disclaims all warranties
    related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties of
    accuracy, reliability, and any implied warranties of merchantability,
    fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.
</p>
<p><strong>H. Electronic Signatures</strong></p>
<p>
    Parts of the Services include features that allow Users to electronically
    sign documents and forms. You agree that (i) the Client that invited or
    added you to the Services (for example: the educational institution that is
    your employer or that you attend as a student) and its End Users exclusively
    control and have sole responsibility for all documents, forms, agreements,
    information, content, communications, and other material submitted to you
    for electronic signature (collectively, “<strong>Esign Content</strong>”);
    and (ii) you exclusively control and have sole responsibility for evaluating
    the accuracy, completeness, and appropriateness of all Esign Content and for
    choosing whether to electronically sign any Esign Content. Please note that
    (i) certain types of forms, documents, agreements, and other materials may
    be excluded, limited, or otherwise restricted by electronic signature laws
    and regulations, and/or (ii) certain laws and regulations may impose
    specific requirements, limitations, and restrictions on specific types of
    electronic signature content and requests. Clients and End Users, as
    applicable, are solely responsible and liable for complying with all such
    laws and regulations. Apptegy disclaims all responsibility and liability for
    all electronic signature content and requests, and all harm, claims,
    consequences, losses, and damages (direct or indirect) arising in any way
    out of or related to all electronic signature content and requests. Apptegy
    Entities will not be liable in any manner or form, or under any theory or
    cause of action, for electronic signature content and requests, posted on or
    communicated via the Services unless Apptegy is the author of the content or
    request.
</p>
<p><strong>I. Accessibility Compliance</strong></p>
<p>
    Clients are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws and
    regulations governing accessibility of the parts of the Services under the
    control of the Client (for example: a Client’s website and/or mobile
    applications, and Client and End User activities on the Services, including
    communications), including, but not limited to, the Americans with
    Disabilities Act, as it may be amended (“<strong>ADA</strong>”), and the
    requirements and policies of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
    (“<strong>WCAG</strong>”). We encourage Clients to establish and implement
    methods and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
    regulations, including the ADA and the WCAG, and to inform and train each of
    its employees, contractors, and representatives who use the Services on the
    methods and procedures. The Services include tools to assist Clients with
    accessibility compliance, and Apptegy may provide Clients with materials and
    information about such laws and regulations, including the ADA and the WCAG.
    All such tools, materials, and information are provided to assist Clients
    with their compliance obligations and for general education purposes only.
    Apptegy disclaims all responsibility and liability for compliance with all
    laws and regulations governing accessibility of the parts of the Services
    under the control of Clients (for example: a Client’s website and/or mobile
    applications, and Client and End User activities on the Services, including
    communications), including the ADA and/or the WCAG, and all harm, claims,
    consequences, losses, and damages (direct or indirect) arising in any way
    out of or related to accessibility, or lack thereof, to the parts of the
    Services under the control of Clients. Apptegy Entities will not be liable
    in any manner or form, or under any theory or cause of action, for
    compliance with any laws and regulations governing accessibility of the
    parts of the Services under the control of Clients.
</p>
<p><strong>J. How These Terms Apply Across Different Services</strong></p>
<p>
    These Terms apply to all parts of the Services, unless and only to the
    extent expressly set out in these Terms. Any exceptions will be clearly
    explained in these Terms. For example, if a specific term or condition does
    not apply, or applies differently, to Media as compared to Rooms, or to one
    feature of Media as compared to another feature of Media, then that
    difference will be explained in these Terms. If you do not see a specific
    difference or exception listed in these Terms, then it is not a difference
    or exception, and the general term or condition applies to all parts of the
    Services.
</p>
<p><strong>11. Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>
    By using the Services, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
    you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the Apptegy Entities
    (as defined above) for all claims and liabilities (actual and threatened),
    obligations, settlements, losses, expenses, debts, and damages (including
    costs and attorneys’ fees) (collectively, “<strong>Claims</strong>”) that
    arise from or relate to (i) your breach of any part of these Terms or our
    Privacy Policy, including any activity and content associated with your
    account (whether by you or a third party), (ii) information or materials you
    post, upload, share, or otherwise provide on or through the Services; (iii)
    your infringement or violation of copyright, patent, trademark, trade
    secret, or other intellectual property or related rights of any third party;
    (iv) any third party services that you access or use via the Services;
    and/or (v) your negligent or willful misconduct; unless a court of competent
    jurisdiction enters a final judgment that the Claim was the result of
    affirmative and intentional actions or omissions by Apptegy. You agree to
    promptly notify Apptegy of any actual or potential Claim of which you become
    aware. Apptegy reserves the right to assume exclusive control of and direct
    the defense or settlement of any third party Claim otherwise subject to
    indemnification by you. You agree to assist and cooperate with Apptegy in
    the defense upon request.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client
    Agreement will control and govern with respect to all matters expressly
    addressed in the Client Agreement, and those terms and conditions may differ
    from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p><strong>12. Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12, for Users with
    a Client Agreement, the Client Agreement will control and govern with
    respect to all matters expressly addressed in the Client Agreement, and
    those terms and conditions may differ from those set out in this section.
</p>
<p><strong>A. Waiver and Severability</strong></p>
<p>
    The failure of Apptegy to enforce any right or term of these Terms will not
    be a waiver of the right or term. If any term is held to be invalid or
    unenforceable, then that term will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
    extent necessary, and the remaining parts of these Terms will stay in full
    force and effect. In such an instance, the parties agree that the intent of
    the original language should be enforceable against the parties to the
    maximum extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p><strong>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>
    These Terms and any dispute related to the Terms will be governed by the
    laws of Delaware without regard to conflicts of law principles. Subject to
    the dispute resolution terms set out in Section 12.C below, all claims and
    legal proceedings arising in connection with the Services will be brought
    exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Little Rock, Arkansas,
    United States, and you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
    those courts.
</p>
<p><strong>C. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
<p>
    You agree that you will notify Apptegy in writing of any dispute related to
    the Services. Apptegy will have thirty (30) days from receipt of your
    written notice to address the dispute before you may initiate any third
    party action to resolve the dispute. Notice under this section must be
    addressed to Apptegy, Inc., c/o Notice of Dispute, 2201 Brookwood Drive,
    Suite 115, Little Rock, Arkansas 72202.
</p>
<p>
    Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
    that is not voluntarily resolved by the parties pursuant to the previous
    paragraph must be finally settled by arbitration in Little Rock, Arkansas,
    by JAMS, Inc. (“<strong>JAMS</strong>”) or its successor, under the then
    applicable JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures. Judgment
    on or enforcement of the arbitration award may be entered in any court
    having jurisdiction. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on
    an individual basis: CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.
    BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE
    RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. Notwithstanding
    the previous obligations, each party will have the right to start an action
    at any time for injunctive or equitable relief in the mandatory jurisdiction
    and venue established above. If you are a resident of a jurisdiction where
    binding arbitration and class action waivers are not valid, this section
    will not apply to you.
</p>
<p><strong>D. Consent to Electronic Communication</strong></p>
<p>
    By using the Services, you agree to receive all communications related to
    your use of the Services in electronic form, including, but not limited to,
    emails sent to the email address associated with your account, and/or posted
    notices on the Services. By using the Services, you agree that all
    agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications from Apptegy that
    are provided electronically will satisfy all legal requirements that
    communications be in writing. All notices from Apptegy will be deemed
    effective when sent to the email address associated with your account, or
    when posted publicly on the Services.

<p>
    <strong
        >E. Entire Agreement; Relationship to Other Agreements;
        Assignment</strong
    >
</p>
<p>
    These Terms and the Privacy Policy are the entire and exclusive agreement
    between Apptegy and you about the Services and supersede and replace any
    prior agreement or understanding between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    for Users with a Client Agreement, the Client Agreement will also be part of
    our agreement.
</p>
<p>
    Apptegy may offer additional services to supplement the Services (for
    example: marketing services). Supplemental services may require you to enter
    into a separate agreement with us and/or be subject to additional terms
    specific to the supplemental services. Supplemental services are in the sole
    discretion of Apptegy.
</p>
<p>
    The agreement established by these Terms is made for the sole benefit of
    Apptegy and the User, and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
    Except as expressly provided in these Terms, no other person or entity is
    intended to or will have the rights or benefits provided under these Terms,
    whether as third party beneficiaries or otherwise. None of the Terms, nor
    any right, obligation, or remedy under the Terms is assignable,
    transferable, or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent.
    Any attempted assignment, transfer, or sublicense by you without our prior
    written consent is null and void. Apptegy may assign, transfer, or delegate
    these Terms or any right or obligation or remedy under these Terms in its
    sole discretion.
</p>
<p><strong>F. Changes to Terms; Supplemental Terms</strong></p>
<p>
    We may change these Terms from time to time in our discretion. The most
    current version will always be at the following link:
    https://www.apptegy.com/terms-and-conditions/. We encourage you to review it
    regularly. Any changes will be effective immediately upon us posting the
    updated Terms. If we make updates or changes, we will give notice by
    updating the posted date for these Terms. In some cases and in our sole
    discretion, we may provide additional notice (for example: by a pop-up or
    banner notice on the Services, or by sending you an email notification). By
    continuing to use the Services after changes are effective, you will be
    bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree with any updates to these
    Terms, you may not continue to use the Services. Notwithstanding the
    foregoing, if we make updates or changes that materially change User rights
    with respect to personal information, or reduce the level of protection for
