        <h4><span style="color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">4. Term; Fees; Renewals</span></h4>

        <ol type="a">
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subscription Term.</span> A Subscription to the Services is provided for either a monthly plan or a specified term plan. In either case, unless otherwise stated in an Order Form, this Agreement shall begin on the Effective Date and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this Agreement, shall remain in place for the initial term agreed to by Customer when You converted Your Free Trial license or signed up to become a Customer for the Services (the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Term</span>”). You are subscribing to the Services for the full length of the Term of the applicable Subscription. This means that if You terminate Your Subscription prior to the end of the then-current Term of the Subscription, or We terminate access to the Services as a result of Your Default (including without limitation, Your failure to pay any sum due hereunder or violations of Section 3(c)(Restrictions) – each, a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Default</span>"), You will be responsible for any applicable charges for the full Term of the Subscription as if You remained a customer through the end of the then-current Term of the Subscription, including, without limitation, outstanding charges and unbilled charges. In addition, You will not be entitled to a refund for any unused portion of prepaid Subscription charges.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subscription Fees.</span> Customer shall pay Huntress the agreed Fees for the Subscription to the Services. Huntress’s monitoring systems will be used to track purchases and usage of the Services. All Fees are non-refundable, unless otherwise stated herein.
                        <ol type="i">
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Payment.</span> If Customer purchases a license or Subscription to the Services through the Online Portal or provides credit card payment details with an Order Form: Customer expressly agrees that Huntress is permitted to invoice and charge the credit card or accepted payment account the applicable Fees, any applicable taxes, and any other charges that Customer may incur with Huntress in connection with its use of the Services and that such Fees, taxes, and related charges will be billed to the credit card or accepted payment account that Customer provides at the time a Fee or charge is due and payable. Customer will be charged for the minimum number of licenses based on the Subscription option it selected at checkout or via an Order Form. Customer will also be charged for each additional license over the minimum based on the per unit Fee of the selected Subscription option.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Third-Party Processor.</span> We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to bill Customers. Huntress does not store any of Customer’s credit card information, and the credit card information will not be shared with any company other than the Payment Processor. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor. By utilizing the Services, You agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, in accordance with the applicable payment terms.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Late Fees.</span> If payment is not received or cannot be charged to Your credit card or accepted payment account for any reason in advance of the applicable Term, Huntress reserves the right to either suspend or terminate Your access to the Services. Overdue balances are subject to interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the highest rate allowable by law, whichever is less. In the event You fail to make timely payment, You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by Huntress in collecting such amounts.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Taxes.</span> Fees are exclusive of any applicable governmental excise, sales, use, value-added, income, withholding, and other taxes or levies, however designated. Customer shall pay all such taxes levied or imposed by reason of Customer’s purchase of the Services and the transactions hereunder, except for taxes based on Huntress’s income or with respect to Huntress’s employment of its employees. If Customer is exempt from any taxes, it shall promptly provide Huntress with satisfactory evidence of such exemption or it shall be liable and invoiced with its order or in the future for such taxes.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">License Upgrade.</span> You may switch to a higher minimum license tier Subscription at any time. Doing so will start a new Subscription of the same duration as Your original Term with a new effective date as of the last billing date.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Currency.</span> All Fees are payable in U.S. Dollars, unless otherwise specified. For Customers who pay the Fees in a foreign currency (i.e., non-U.S. Dollars), Huntress reserves the right to adjust the Fees should the U.S. dollar depreciate or appreciate by more than fifteen percent (15%) from the current Huntress published Fee list.</li>
                        </ol>
                </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Free Trial Services.</span> If Customer is approved by Huntress for a Free Trial to the Services, Huntress will make the applicable Services available to Customer free of any Fees, subject to these Terms, having a Term from the Effective Date until: (i) the end of the Free Trial period communicated by Huntress to Customer; (ii) the start date of a purchased Subscription ordered by Customer for such Service(s); or (iii) termination by Huntress in its sole discretion.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Purchases from Resellers.</span> If You are purchasing the Services through a Huntress authorized partner or reseller, then the Fees shall be as set forth between You and partner/reseller and the applicable Fees shall be paid directly to the partner/reseller, and this Section 4 (Terms; Fees; Renewals) shall not apply. In the event such partner/reseller fails to pay Huntress for use of the Services, then Huntress may suspend or terminate Your access to all or any part of the Services upon written notice, until payment is received by Huntress, regardless of whether You have paid such partner/reseller.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Renewal Subscriptions.</span>
                        <ol type="i">
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Monthly Plan.</span> As long as You are subscribed to the monthly plan, You acknowledge and agree that Huntress will charge Your credit card or accepted payment account on record with Huntress at the beginning of each new billing cycle for the previous cycle unless You unsubscribe in accordance with these Terms or as provided for in the Online Portal. You will be billed for the minimum number of licenses required for the monthly plan as well as any additional licenses over the minimum.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic Renewal of Term Plan.</span> Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, <span style="font-weight: bold;">YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME DURATION OF YOUR ORIGINAL SUBSCRIPTION AT THE THEN-CURRENT RENEWAL FEES FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THE THEN-CURRENT TERMS, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT (AS SET FORTH BELOW) PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION.</span> The current renewal fee will be displayed in the Online Portal and the current Terms will be available at <a href="https://www.huntress.com/legal">www.huntress.com/legal.</a></li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">How to Terminate Renewals.</span> Customer may opt out of auto-renewal of its Subscription by using the Online Portal or by contacting its account representative. If Customer terminates its Subscription prior to the next Subscription renewal term, it will not be obligated to pay any additional Fees for upcoming Subscription renewal terms, but any Subscription Fees that You have paid in advance will not be refunded. By terminating Your Subscription per this clause, however, You are not released from Your obligations for the remainder of Your current Subscription. You must also uninstall any installed Software by the end of your Term, or your Subscription will convert to a monthly plan as described in the next section unless you are given a grace period by Huntress to uninstall the Software after termination.</li>
                                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Failure to Uninstall After Termination. IF YOU FAIL TO UNINSTALL SOFTWARE AFTER YOU HAVE UNSUBSCRIBED AND YOU HAVE NOT BEEN GRANTED A GRACE PERIOD BY HUNTRESS TO UNINSTALL, YOUR PLAN WILL BE CONVERTED TO A MONTHLY PLAN AND YOU WILL BE CHARGED AT THE CURRENT MONTHLY RATES UNTIL ALL SOFTWARE IS UNINSTALLED OR HUNTRESS HAS OTHERWISE AGREED IN WRITING.</span> </li>
