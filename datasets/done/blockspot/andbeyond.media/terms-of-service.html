            <h3>4. LINKS AND THIRD PARTY CONTENT</h3>
            <p class="description pt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
              AndBeyond.Media may itself, and working with a number of third
              parties, provide links to other websites or resources from the
              Site. AndBeyond.Media may also provide the opportunity for third
              parties to submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available
              information, data, text, photographs, sound, graphics, video,
              messages, reviews or other materials ("Third Party Content")
              though the Site. Because AndBeyond.Media has no control over the
              content and performance of any third party websites, resources or
              such Third Party Content, AndBeyond.Media makes no guarantees
              about the accuracy, integrity, content, availability or quality of
              the information or services provided by such websites, resources
              or Third Party Content, and AndBeyond.Media assumes no
              responsibility for unintended, objectionable, inaccurate,
              misleading or unlawful content that may be accessed. Under no
              circumstances will AndBeyond.Media be liable in any way for any
              Third Party Content or services provided by any third party

            <p class="description pt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
              You are required to use the Site responsibly. AndBeyond.Media
              reserves the right to suspend and/or cancel access to any user who
              uses the Site in such a way that adversely affects other
              www.andbeyond.media's users. While AndBeyond.Media may monitor its
              service electronically to determine that its facilities are
              operating satisfactorily, as a general practice, AndBeyond.Media
              does not monitor its users' activities to determine whether they
              are in compliance with the Policy. However, when AndBeyond.Media

              agreements, AndBeyond.Media may take any action to stop or correct
              such violation, including, but not limited to, denying access to
              the Site. In addition, AndBeyond.Media may take action against you
              or a customer of yours because of the activities of you or such
              customer.

            <h3>7. ACTIONS TAKEN BY AndBeyond.Media</h3>
            <p class="description pt-3" style="text-align: justify;">
              AndBeyond.Media will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a
              violation of the Policy. AndBeyond.Media reserves the right to
              remove any Third Party Content without prior notice and to refuse
              access to anyone at any time. When AndBeyond.Media becomes aware
              of an alleged violation of its Policy, AndBeyond.Media will
              initiate an investigation. During the investigation,
              AndBeyond.Media may restrict your access to the Site in order to
              prevent further potentially unauthorized activity. Depending on
              the severity of the violation, AndBeyond.Media may, at its sole
              discretion, restrict, suspend, or terminate to the Site and/or
              pursue other civil remedies. If such violation is a criminal
              offense, AndBeyond.Media will notify the appropriate law
              enforcement authorities of such violation. An unlisted activity
              may also be a violation of the Policy if it is illegal,
              irresponsible, or constitutes disruptive use of the Internet. If
              you are found to be in violation of the Policy, you are
              responsible, without limitations, for the cost of labor to rectify
              any damage done to the operation of the Site and business
              operations supported by the Site, and to respond to complaints
              incurred by AndBeyond.Media.

              AndBeyond.Media is concerned with the privacy of on-line
              communications and websites. In general, the Internet is neither
              more nor less secure than other means of communication, including
              mail, facsimile, and voice telephone service, all of which can be
              intercepted and otherwise compromised. As a matter of prudence,
              however, AndBeyond.Media urges its customers to assume that all of
              their online communications are insecure. AndBeyond.Media cannot
              take any responsibility for the security of information
              transmitted over AndBeyond.Media facilities. All information
              gathered by us from you in connection with your use of this site
              is subject to the provisions of our Privacy Statement. We do not
              control, nor are we responsible for, the privacy practices of
              those sites to which we link and, therefore, you agree to read the
              privacy policies of those sites.

              <li>
                <h5>A. Jurisdiction and Severability</h5>
                The Policy, and any other agreement for AndBeyond.Media
                services, will be governed by and construed in accordance with
                the laws of courts of Dubai, UAE, without reference to its
                conflicts of laws principles. Any litigation or arbitration
                between a customer and AndBeyond.Media will take place in Dubai,
                UAE, and the customer will consent to personal jurisdiction and
                venue in that jurisdiction. If any provision or portion of the
                Policy or other AndBeyond.Media agreement is found by a court of
                competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, the
                remainder of the Policy or the agreement will continue in full
                force and effect.
              </li>
              <li class="pt-2">
                <h5>B. No Waiver</h5>
                Any failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the
                Policy will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
              </li>
              <li class="pt-2">
                <h5>C. Construction and Interpretation</h5>
                Wherever in this Policy the masculine, feminine, or neuter
                gender is used, it will be construed as including all genders,
                and wherever the singular is used, it will be deemed to include
                the plural and vice versa, where the context so requires. The
                division of the Policy into sections/paragraphs, and the
                insertion of headings/captions, are for convenience of reference
                only and will not affect the construction or interpretation of
                the Policy. Any rule of construction to the effect that any
                ambiguity is to be resolved against the drafting party will not
                be applicable in the construction or interpretation of the
                Policy.
              </li>
              <li class="pt-2">
                <h5>D. Complete Agreement and Exclusivity</h5>
                The Policy, and/or any other specific agreement for
                AndBeyond.Media services, constitutes the complete understanding
                and agreement between yourself and AndBeyond.Media with respect
                to the subject matter hereof, and governs your use of the Site.
                You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that
                may apply when you use affiliate services, Third Party Content
                or third-party software. Except when expressly agreed to the
                contrary in signed writing by an authorized representative of
                AndBeyond.Media, the Policy supersedes any other written
                (including digitized/computerized) agreement, oral agreement,
                and/or agreement by conduct. This Policy, and/or any other
                specific agreement for AndBeyond.Media services is between
                AndBeyond.Media and its customers only and will not confer any
                rights in any third party except as otherwise expressly provided
                by AndBeyond.Media.
