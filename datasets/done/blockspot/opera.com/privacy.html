                    <h2 data-block-key="sbqlq">Opera Privacy Statement</h2><p data-block-key="ecbs0"><i>Last updated: February 14, 2025</i></p><p data-block-key="rtpc"></p><h2 data-block-key="9048n">Introduction</h2><p data-block-key="6ve8k">This privacy statement describes how we use data in our browsers, websites, and services. Some of the data we use is considered “personal data” under applicable law. However, even when we use personal data, we generally have no way of actually identifying you as an individual, and our users are essentially anonymous to us.</p><p data-block-key="8s1p8">The specific categories of data that we collect, use, or otherwise process can vary from product to product, from one purpose to another, and in some cases based on your location. This privacy statement sets out when, how, and why we process your data (including but not limited to personal data), as well as your rights under applicable law.</p><p data-block-key="7piq5"></p><h2 data-block-key="b34lk">Definitions</h2><p data-block-key="5chog">First, let’s define some key terms. Many of these definitions are adapted (with changes) from the General Data Protection Regulation (or “GDPR”), the data privacy law which applies in the European Union as well as in Norway. We use the GDPR as a guidepost because it applies directly to our European companies and because we believe it sets the highest legal standard for user privacy. However, in some cases we have simplified definitions here for the purpose of clarity.</p><p data-block-key="7pg9t"><b>Personal data:</b> “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person” as the GDPR says. This includes data such as your IP address, device IDs, advertising IDs, and location. Below where we describe how we process personal data, we also list the specific purpose for doing so, as well as our legal basis under the GDPR (as those terms are defined below).</p><p data-block-key="7ev68"><b>Data controller:</b> The person or company that decides whether and how to process personal data.</p><p data-block-key="28ph0"><b>Data processor:</b> Someone who processes personal data on behalf of a data controller.</p><p data-block-key="eg7vt"><b>Legal basis:</b> the specific legal grounds we use for processing personal data. The GDPR sets out six specific grounds for processing personal data. The ones most relevant to our Applications are as follows:</p><p data-block-key="67oh3"><b>Consent:</b> When we process personal data based on your consent, that means you’ve expressly given us permission to do so.</p><p data-block-key="8nfm8"><b>Contractual grounds:</b> When we process personal data because it is necessary to perform a contract, for example to provide you with a service as described in our Terms of Service or some other agreement.</p><p data-block-key="7o0kp"><b>Legitimate interest:</b> When we process personal data based on legitimate interest, that means we have some use for the personal data (such as monetization, or ensuring that products work properly) which is in balance with your right to privacy.</p><p data-block-key="esnmm"><b>Legal compliance:</b> In some instances it is necessary for us to process personal data in order to fulfill other obligations under the law, for example detecting fraud, making sure you are who you say you are, etc.</p><p data-block-key="7m7d5"><b>Applications:</b> the specific apps we offer, as mentioned below, including our desktop and mobile browsers.</p><p data-block-key="2f265"><b>Monetization:</b> making money. Nearly all of our Applications are free to download and use. Therefore we monetize our products in various ways, mostly by selling advertising within the Applications themselves. The money we make helps us keep the lights on, pay the salaries of our staff, and continue developing the most innovative, independent browsers on the market. However, when we monetize our Applications, we never sell our users’ personal data to anyone.</p><p data-block-key="ia1k"><b>Purpose:</b> the specific reason or reasons we have for processing personal data.</p><p data-block-key="e2gn0"><b>Process or processing:</b> collecting or using personal data. As defined in the GDPR, the word “processing” can mean doing almost anything with personal data. Below we have used it in this general sense when we have a general meaning in mind, and used more specific terms (like “store” or “share”) where appropriate.</p><p data-block-key="1sdna"><b>Retention / retain:</b> the time period for which we will continue to store data. In general, we do not process or store personal data longer than needed and therefore delete it after a certain period of time. Below we have included some more specific details on retention periods, which vary depending on the type of personal data at issue and the purpose for which it is processed.</p><p data-block-key="ddtj6"><b>Transfer:</b> Personal data is “transferred” when it is sent or made permanently available to someone or some company outside the European Economic Area (or EEA - that is the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein).</p><p data-block-key="c0cfi"><b>Opera Group:</b> Our affiliated group of companies, including Opera Norway AS (a Norwegian company) which develops and publishes the Opera browsers, as well as other subsidiaries and affiliated companies around the world. For more information, see below.</p>

However, you have the option to create an<a href="https://auth.opera.com/"> Opera account</a> to use certain services (like our blogs, VPN Pro, Loomi, or Cashback, etc.). Again, you do not have to create an Opera account to use our browser applications for regular browsing activities, such as browsing the web.</p><p data-block-key="9591r">If you choose to create an <a href="https://auth.opera.com/">Opera account</a>, we ask for a preferred username and an email address. The email address will be used to identify you as a user and for password recovery. Alternatively, you can use your Facebook, Twitter, or VK account to sign in into an Opera account and access our services with the same profile. In this case we collect information such as your name, profile picture, and email address from these social networks. If you use your Opera account in conjunction with a service like VPN Pro or Cashback, whatever data we process in connection with those services will be associated with your Opera account.</p><p data-block-key="3fpg5">You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your <a href="https://auth.opera.com/account/edit-profile">profile page</a>. We retain your data for seven days after you’ve decided to discontinue your Opera account in case you change your mind. Your Opera account with a verified email address will be deleted automatically if you don’t sign in for two years. Accounts with unverified email addresses will be deleted after six months of inactivity.</p><p data-block-key="3grfp">Note also that Opera allows you to sync your browser data, such as Speed Dial entries and bookmarks, between devices that have another Opera browser installed on them.

Aria is powered by OpenAI and Google (both US-based companies).</p><p data-block-key="51pmn">To access Aria, you do not need to sign into your Opera account, however if you do log in, you’ll get access to additional/extended features of Aria. We do not share your Opera account data with anyone, including OpenAI or Google. For more information on how we use and retain Opera account data, see the section on Opera account above.</p><p data-block-key="b56ut">Your input (all data that you choose to provide to Aria, including any personal data) is shared with OpenAI or Google in order to provide you with responses. Aria also automatically processes your input to give you more precise or meaningful responses. Moreover, based on your inputs, Aria identifies prompts that are shared with Google for the purpose of generating Google Search Suggestions to enrich the response you receive from Aria. We will ask you for your consent for such data processing when you use Aria for the first time. Aria has several additional features, which you may choose to use (e.g. context mode, image generation, voice output, image understanding, tabs management). Aforesaid features may require collecting and processing additional data, i.e. URL and tab names. To learn more, please read our <a href="https://help.opera.com/en/browser-ai-faq/">FAQ</a>.</p><p data-block-key="9lb54">After your session is complete, your chats, URL and tab names will be stored locally on your device and on Opera servers but will not be retained by OpenAI or Google.</p><p data-block-key="4n66">If you use Aria without logging into your Opera account, all aforementioned data will be permanently deleted after 48 hours, and you will not have access to them on your device.</p><p data-block-key="52a1l">If you use Aria while logged into your Opera account, then the aforementioned data will be automatically removed after 30 days from Opera’s servers but will still be available on your device. At any time, you can delete your chats (both stored locally and on Opera servers), by going to the chats list by clicking the chat bubble icon on the top bar of the chat. There you can either delete them one at a time by swiping, or you can select multiple chats and delete them all at once by clicking the bin icon.</p><p data-block-key="1c9lm">You may always opt - out from Google search suggestions feature via Aria Settings.</p><p data-block-key="cqct7">Purpose: To provide and manage the service.</p><p data-block-key="ekq5a">Legal basis: Legitimate interest (for Opera account data), Consent (for any data you input to Aria), Contractual grounds (other data).</p><p data-block-key="2c4d2"></p><h3 data-block-key="3s9p5">Data Compression</h3><p data-block-key="4lh14">Extreme-savings mode (in Opera Mini) renders web pages on our servers before sending a compressed version of the content to the application on your device. High-savings mode (Opera Turbo) does not render content, but our servers look through your requests to see if any elements on the page can be compressed before sending them to your device. If you use extreme-savings mode or Opera Turbo in Opera Mini we log your IP address as well as a randomly generated ID, advertising ID, and URLs of your requests that are sent through our servers, but not the content. We may also log a phone number and IMEI, if they were provided by your mobile operator. If you use Opera Turbo in Opera for Android, we log IP address as well as a randomly generated ID, advertising ID, and URLs of your requests that are sent through our servers, but not the content.

To enable payouts, your <a href="https://auth.opera.com/">Opera account</a> will be linked with a payment service provider, which will share your customer ID, and relevant payment related data with Opera. Your payment data may be stored for up to five years due to regulatory requirements. You can modify your Opera account, delete it, or request a copy of your data using your <a href="https://auth.opera.com/account/edit-profile">profile page</a>.

In most cases Google is the default provider, but other providers (such as Bing) might be set as default based on which version of the Application you are using. You can always change your default provider in the settings menu. Opera does not share personal data with search engine providers to enable search within Opera browsers.</p><p data-block-key="9v58n">Just like any other third-party website you might access, use of any search engine is subject to the terms of service and privacy policy offered by the specific search engine provider.

We collect this identifier, as well as Device ID, hardware specifications (model, release date, etc.), operating system, environment configuration, and feature usage data to improve our products and services. For example, we may use it to analyze how our users interact with our applications, or to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, or to detect and debug problems. We have no practical way of using this information to identify you personally. We retain this usage data for up to three years.

We do not log or store your entire browsing history for this purpose. Instead we simply make a record of whether you have visited certain categories of websites based on the domains of pages you visit and mix it with other data (which might depend on which application you use, and may include page loads, number of SpeedDial clicks, whether you have ad blocker enabled or not, etc.) to make an informed guess about whether you are interested in broad categories of interests (such as sports, gaming, news, etc.). We then add this basic profile to other data, such as your general location (country or city) in order to enable our advertising partners to target their ads to groups of users who might be interested in their products and services. We do not share your personal interests or browsing history with anyone. We retain this data for up to one year after which it is deleted automatically.</p><p data-block-key="bd8n">We process this data based on your consent.
