<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> . NKL Associates is committed to fostering a safe and secure online environment for users of the Website. NKL Associates does not tolerate the display or dissemination of any Submissions that violate applicable laws or these Terms of Service (such as child sexual abuse material, non-consensual sexual acts, privacy violations, abuse, harassment, etc.) on the Website and upon becoming aware of such illegal Submissions, NKL Associates will expeditiously remove or disable access to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to our <span style="font-weight: bold;">notice and action procedure</span> (as described below), NKL Associates undertakes voluntary own-initiative investigations in good faith and diligent manner, aiming to detect, identify, and remove or disable access to illegal Submissions. These efforts include employing avant-garde automated detection technologies capable of identifying various types of illegal content, supplemented by manual review conducted by our well-trained team of human content moderators. Furthermore, Submissions undergo thorough checks for malware, viruses, or other malicious software prior to uploading. Ultimately, the decision to remove a Submission, rests with the human content moderator. NKL Associates does not utilize algorithmic decision-making for content moderation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recognizing the importance of responsible content moderation, NKL Associates is ready to work closely with certified Trusted Flaggers from the European Economic Area (" <span style="font-weight: bold;">EEA</span> ") to swiftly identify and address any Submissions that violate these Terms of Service or applicable laws. This cooperative effort reflects our commitment to upholding the highest standards of user safety and promoting a positive online experience for all. Through this collaborative approach, we aim to continuously improve our content moderation processes and maintain a platform that prioritizes the well-being of our users and the integrity of our online community. Trusted Flaggers from the EEA who have been certified by the relevant Digital Services Coordinator can join our Trusted Flagger programme here: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">https://info.xnxx.com/trusted-flaggers</span> , and have their notices and complaints prioritised.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">9. Recommender System Transparency</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The criteria influencing the display of videos on the Website vary depending on the specific section of the Website visited by the user. On the main page, key factors include (i) the user's chosen location (country) and, within that location, (ii) the video's popularity, determined by the total number of clicks from recipients. Users can easily modify these parameters by selecting a different location on the Website&rsquo; online interface. Beyond the main page, the selection of suggested videos is also influenced by the chosen 'category' (sub-genre) or a particular content creator. Users can easily impact this by selecting a different category or choosing another content creator within the Website&rsquo;s online interface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Users may also search for specific type of content using keywords. In this case, the decisive criterion is the match between the entered keyword(s) and the video's title or 'tags' and within such searched videos, their popularity. Tags are more detailed textual specifications of the video. For instance, a 'tag' may represent one or more specific sub-categories or a particular model(s) featured in the video.The Website also provides a feature of suggesting 'related' videos which is based on viewing history of all users. When 'view history' is enabled, the system suggests more relevant videos based on the context of the respective video, considering criteria such as &lsquo;popularity&rsquo;, 'categories' or 'tags'.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">13. Internal Complaint-Handling System, Dispute Resolution, Agreement to Arbitrate, Class Action Waiver, Venue and Forum</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">13.1 Handling complaints internally</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon a decision from NKL Associates:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">about whether or not to remove or disable access to or restrict visibility of information that is the subject of a complaint; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">about whether or not to suspend or terminate the provision of the service, in whole or in part, to one or more recipient(s); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">about whether or not to suspend or terminate the account of the recipient(s); or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify;">about whether or not to suspend, terminate or otherwise restrict the ability to monetise information provided by the recipients,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">on the grounds that the information provided by the recipients constitutes illegal content or is incompatible with NKL Associates&rsquo;s Terms of Service, recipients of the service shall be able to lodge complaints against the decision of NKL Associates, electronically and free of charge. Recipients shall have the right to lodge such complaints for 6 months from the date they are informed of the relevant decision. Recipients may submit a complaint through their user account interface or through the designated link that was emailed to them by NKL Associates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NKL Associates shall handle such complaints submitted through its internal complaint-handling system in a timely, diligent, non-discriminatory and non-arbitrary manner, under the supervision of qualified content moderators, and not solely on the basis of automated means. Where appropriate, NKL Associates shall reverse its decisions as a result of the complaints. Recipients located in the EEA shall be provided with a reasoned decision in respect of the information to which the complaint relates and of the possibility of out-of-court dispute settlement (as described under 13.2 of these Terms of Service) and other available possibilities for redress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">13.2 Out-of-court dispute settlement bodies available to recipients located in the EEA</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the other dispute resolution mechanisms set out in this Clause, in relation to any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with content that is, or has been alleged to be, illegal or incompatible with NKL Associates&rsquo;s Terms of Service, recipients located in the EEA (namely in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) may refer the matter to any of the out-of-court dispute settlement bodies certified in accordance with Art. 21 of the Digital Services Act.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">13.3 Arbitration</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Either Party may refer any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before bringing a formal legal case in arbitration, you must send a written notice of dispute ("Notice of Dispute") via registered mail to "NKL Associates s.r.o., Krakovska 1366/25, 110 00 Prague, Czech Republic, Attn: Dispute Resolution- Subject: Notice of Dispute" to give NKL Associates the opportunity to resolve the dispute with you informally, as also indicated in Section 12 of these Terms of Service. Similarly, before commencing a formal legal case in arbitration against a counterparty, NKL Associates will send a Notice of Dispute to the counterparty&rsquo;s registered address.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Notice of Dispute must contain sufficient information to identify the claiming Party (&ldquo;Claimant&rdquo;) and the basis of its claim. Amicable consultations will commence upon NKL Associates's or counterparty&rsquo;s receipt of a Notice of Dispute.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You and NKL Associates agree to negotiate the dispute in good faith for no less than 30 days after a valid Notice of Dispute is provided. If the dispute cannot be resolved by amicable consultations within 30 days after receipt of a Notice of Dispute, you agree that ANY and all existing and/or future controversy and/or claim between you and NKL Associates shall be resolved as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">i. No Class Actions</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neither you nor NKL Associates may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any claim or dispute. Claims or disputes may not be arbitrated or resolved on a class or representative basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ii. You and NKL Associates Agree to Arbitrate</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You and NKL Associates agree to the fullest extent permitted by law to resolve any claims arising out of, relating in any manner to, or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or NKL Associates's services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, through final and binding arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An arbitration proceeding is before neutral arbitrators instead of a judge and jury, so by voluntarily accepting these Terms of Service, you and NKL Associates agree to give up the right to a trial before a judge and jury with respect to any and all claims relating to, arising out of, or in connection with your use of the Website or with the Terms of Service referred to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This agreement applies to all claims except those identified in Section 13 (v). This agreement applies even after you stop using or choose to delete your xnxx.com account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">iii. The Arbitration Process</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic ("Arbitration Court") will conduct any arbitration between you and NKL Associates, except for disputes in which the Czech state courts have exclusive jurisdiction under Czech law. The parties agree that the Rules of the Arbitration Court are applicable and will govern. You may read the Rules of the Arbitration Court here at https://en.soud.cz/rules. This webpage address is potentially subject to change as it is not under NKL Associates's control. If any terms in these Terms of Service conflict with any Rules of the Arbitration Court, the parties agree to follow these Terms of Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Disputes shall be resolved by a panel of three arbitrators (&ldquo;Arbitrators&rdquo;) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Court in effect at the time the Notice of Dispute was filed or received by NKL Associates. The resulting award shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. The seat of the arbitration shall be Prague, Czech Republic; the proceedings shall take place in Prague, Czech Republic; and the language of arbitration shall be Czech, unless (i) the parties agree otherwise, or (ii) unless Claimant elects English as the language of arbitration, or (iii) unless any applicable local laws dictate a particular language for the arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The parties agree that any disputes concerning the enforceability, validity, or scope of the arbitration agreement in this Section 13 (or any portion of it) shall be resolved by the Arbitration Court, which will have sole authority to decide those issues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The parties further agree not to pursue injunctive relief (i.e., an order that the other party do or not to do something, apart from paying damages) in arbitration. Such relief must be sought in court instead. If a party has a dispute for which they seek to obtain both injunctive and other forms of relief, the party must go to court to seek the injunctive relief and must arbitrate to seek the other forms of relief.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">iv. Arbitration Fees and Costs</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you start an arbitration in accordance with the Terms of Service, you will be required to pay the Arbitration Court&rsquo;s initial filing fees. If you are a non-EEA Claimant, you will not be responsible for paying any other fees of the Arbitrators, since all other fees and expenses charged by the Arbitrators will be paid by NKL Associates. Additionally, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, NKL Associates will pay that too. If you are an-EEA Claimant, you and NKL Associates will be responsible for paying the respective fees of the Arbitrators, and NKL Associates won&rsquo;t pay but for its fair shares of the Arbitrators fees. Similarly, if you are an-EEA Claimant, if the Arbitrators determine that you are unable to pay all or any part of the filing fee, NKL Associates will not pay that. Based on the ultimate outcome of the arbitration, the Arbitrators may decide in accordance with, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to award attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs to the prevailing party or parties in the arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">v. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You and NKL Associates further agree that the Czech District Courts in Prague, Czech Republic (and not an arbitral tribunal), will have exclusive jurisdiction to resolve disputes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">a. relating to non-EEA Claimant&rsquo;s or NKL Associates's intellectual property (for example, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, or patents) (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;); if you are an EEA Claimant you will still be required to arbitrate IP disputes, OR</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">b. regardless of whether you are an EEA or a non-EEA Claimant, where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief, including where a party seeks other forms of relief but is bound, as per Section 13 (ii), to seek those other forms of relief through arbitration; OR</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">c. regardless of whether you are an EEA or a non-EEA Claimant, any other judicial proceedings which by law is not subject to arbitration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">13.4 Other dispute resolution alternatives</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the event your local law prohibits arbitration, you may submit a motion for the extrajudicial handling of your dispute to the designated authority for extrajudicial handling of the consumer disputes, which is the Czech Trade Inspection Authority (www.coi.cz).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Disputes arising from contracts on service provision concluded online between a consumer with residency in the European Union and a trader established in the European Union can also be resolved using the online dispute resolution platform at https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr .</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alternatively, should either of you and NKL Associates not wish to pursue arbitration, you agree, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, that either of you may commence proceedings before the Czech general courts, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes in which at least one of the parties to the dispute is a consumer, unless mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country provide as a further alternative that a dispute or controversy arising out of, relating to, or in connection with these Terms of Service be handled by the court of the jurisdiction where you reside or are domiciled. If you are acting as an individual consumer and if mandatory statutory consumer protection regulations in your country of residence or domicile contain provisions that are more beneficial for you, such provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Czech law or of Czech courts. Should an election be made in favour of the Czech or other national courts, arbitration will no longer be available under Section 13 of these Terms of Service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Section 13 of these Terms of Service will survive the termination of your relationship with NKL Associates.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">14. Governing Law</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You agree that the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, NKL Associates&rsquo;s Services and any claims or disputes arising out of, relating in any manner to or in connection with the Website, the Terms of Service, your relationship with us, or NKL Associates&rsquo;s Services, including but not limited to your use of the Website and information provided via the Website, shall be governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, except for the laws of the Czech Republic that govern conflict- or choice-of-law. The substantive law of the Czech Republic shall control, to the fullest extent permitted by law.

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">15.Separation of Terms</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each of the paragraphs of these Terms of Service operates separately. If any part of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of any such provision shall not affect the validity of any of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which still apply and are binding.Any unenforceable term will be substituted with a term that comes as close to the unlawful or unenforceable term as possible.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">16. General</h2>

No waiver of any term of these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such Term or any other Term, and NKL Associates's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision.</p>
