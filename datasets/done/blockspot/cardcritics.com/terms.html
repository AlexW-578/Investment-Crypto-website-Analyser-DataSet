Who Has Access to Information CardCritics&trade; does not sell your personal information. The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business: Advertisers. CardCritics&trade; may aggregate personal information and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For example, CardCritics&trade; may aggregate location information and disclose it to advertisers to inform them of where their ads are performing.

In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. In the Event of a Sale.

Sharing and Sale of Personal Information In the preceding 12 months, CardCritics&trade; has disclosed personal information in the &quot;identifiers&quot; category to its email service providers for a business purpose. For instance, if you request to unsubscribe from receiving email newsletters from us, we may share your email address with our marketing partners, such as third party advertising networks and email publishers, to effectuate your request to unsubscribe and to comply with CAN-SPAM. In addition, we may disclose your personal information in any of the above categories if legally required to do so, in our sole discretion, pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property, or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. Also, in the event that we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired, personal information in all of the above categories may be included within the transferred assets.

Personal Information for minors under 16 years of age is neither collected, disclosed, nor sold. There are no financial incentives to disclose. Consumer&#039;s Rights Consumers have several rights under the CCPA regarding their personal information. These include: The right to know what categories and specific pieces of personal information are collected, disclosed for a business purpose, or sold by requesting this information from CardCritics. The right to request deletion of personal information collected or maintained by CardCritics. The right to opt-out of the sale of personal information. The right not to receive discriminatory treatment for choosing to exercise privacy rights under the CCPA. Your Right to Request to Know and How to Submit a Verified Request to Know A &quot;request to know&quot; is a request related to the personal information that a business has about such consumer. It may include a request for any or all of the following from us: specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you; categories of personal information that we have collected about you; categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; categories of personal information that we have sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you; categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information. The CCPA permits requests to know from the same consumer up to twice in a twelve (12) month period. To submit a request to know, you may email us at privacy CardCritics&trade; To process your request, we may require that you submit the following information in conjunction with your request: your first name, last name, California address, phone number, and email address. The information which you provide will be used to verify your request and to attempt to identify you within our data records. If you elect to use an authorized agent to exercise your right to submit a request for information, we may require the following before processing the request: 1) provide proof of your written and signed permission with the authorized agent to act on your behalf; 2) directly verify your own identity with us; and 3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. The information which you submit in conjunction with your request will be used for the express purposes of verification and providing you with responsive information to your request, if required. CardCritics&trade; only stores email addresses for subscribers who have signed up to receive the CardCritics&trade; newsletter. For the remaining non-email subscriber traffic, the only Personal Information collected are IP addresses. In many instances, due to the nature of the Personal Information collected, for non-email subscribers, CardCritics&trade; cannot verify consumers&#039; identities to the degree of certainty required to fulfill requests to know or delete your collected Personal Information. CardCritics&trade; cannot fulfill these requests because email addresses and IP addresses are generally publicly available across various publicly accessibly websites and would not permit CardCritics&trade; to verify Consumers&#039; identities to a reasonable degree of certainty. Your Right to Request Deletion and How to Submit a Verified Request to Delete You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. To submit a request to delete, you may email us at privacy CardCritics&trade;, or send your request to: ConsumerTrack, Inc., 1700 E. Walnut Avenue 2nd Floor, El Segundo, CA 90245. To process your request, we may require that you submit the following information in conjunction with your request: your first name, last name, California address, phone number and email address. The information which you provide will be used to verify your request and to attempt to identify you within our data records. If you elect to use an authorized agent to exercise your right to submit a request for deletion, we may require the following before processing the request: 1) provide proof of your written and signed permission with the authorized agent to act on your behalf; 2) directly verify your own identity with us; and 3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. The information which you submit in conjunction with your request to delete will be used for the express purposes of verification and fulfilling your request, if required. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies. As noted above, CardCritics&trade; only stores email addresses for subscribers who have signed up to receive the CardCritics&trade; newsletter. For the remaining non-email subscriber traffic, the only Personal Information collected are IP addresses. In many instances, due to the nature of the Personal Information collected, for non-email subscribers, CardCritics&trade; cannot verify consumers&#039; identities to the degree of certainty required to fulfill requests to know or delete your collected Personal Information. CardCritics&trade; cannot fulfill these requests because email addresses and IP addresses are generally publicly available across various publicly accessibly websites and would not permit CardCritics&trade; to verify Consumers&#039; identities to a reasonable degree of certainty. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you. Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality. Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law. Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.). Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information&#039;s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research&#039;s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent. Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us. Comply with a legal obligation. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. Your Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of Your Privacy Rights California affords consumers with the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by a business for the exercise of their privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. This means that you cannot be denied goods or services; be charged different prices or rates; be provided with a different level or quality of goods or services; or have it suggested that you will receive a different price or rate or different level or quality of goods or services. However, a business may offer a financial incentive or price or service difference if it is reasonably related to the value of the consumer&#039;s data. A business shall notify consumers of any financial incentive or price or service difference.

<p>In addition, we may disclose your personal information in any of the above categories if legally required to do so, in our sole discretion, pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property, or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

<li>The right to opt-out of the sale of personal information.</li>



<li>The right not to receive discriminatory treatment for choosing to exercise privacy rights under the CCPA.</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Your Right to Request to Know and How to Submit a Verified Request to Know</em></p>



<p>A “request to know” is a request related to the personal information that a business has about such consumer. It may include a request for any or all of the following from us:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>specific pieces of personal information that we have collected about you;</li>



<li>categories of personal information that we have collected about you;&nbsp;</li>



<li>categories of sources from which the personal information was collected;&nbsp;</li>



<li>categories of personal information that we have sold or disclosed for a business purpose about you;</li>



<li>categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</li>



<li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
</ol>



<p>The CCPA permits requests to know from the same consumer up to twice in a twelve (12) month period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To submit a request to know, you may email us at privacy [at] CardCritics&trade; To process your request, we may require that you submit the following information in conjunction with your request: your first name, last name, California address, phone number, and email address. The information which you provide will be used to verify your request and to attempt to identify you within our data records. If you elect to use an authorized agent to exercise your right to submit a request for information, we may require the following before processing the request: 1) provide proof of your written and signed permission with the authorized agent to act on your behalf; 2) directly verify your own identity with us; and 3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. The information which you submit in conjunction with your request will be used for the express purposes of verification and providing you with responsive information to your request, if required.</p>



<p>CardCritics&trade; only stores email addresses for subscribers who have signed up to receive the CardCritics&trade; newsletter. For the remaining non-email subscriber traffic, the only Personal Information collected are IP addresses. In many instances, due to the nature of the Personal Information collected, for non-email subscribers, CardCritics&trade; cannot verify consumers’ identities to the degree of certainty required to fulfill requests to know or delete your collected Personal Information. CardCritics&trade; cannot fulfill these requests because email addresses and IP addresses are generally publicly available across various publicly accessibly websites and would not permit CardCritics&trade; to verify Consumers’ identities to a reasonable degree of certainty.</p>



<p><em>Your Right to Request Deletion and How to Submit a Verified Request to Delete</em></p>



<p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. To submit a request to delete, you may email us at privacy [at] CardCritics&trade;, or send your request to: ConsumerTrack, Inc., 1700 E. Walnut Avenue 2nd Floor, El Segundo, CA 90245. To process your request, we may require that you submit the following information in conjunction with your request: your first name, last name, California address, phone number and email address. The information which you provide will be used to verify your request and to attempt to identify you within our data records. If you elect to use an authorized agent to exercise your right to submit a request for deletion, we may require the following before processing the request: 1) provide proof of your written and signed permission with the authorized agent to act on your behalf; 2) directly verify your own identity with us; and 3) directly confirm with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf. The information which you submit in conjunction with your request to delete will be used for the express purposes of verification and fulfilling your request, if required. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As noted above, CardCritics&trade; only stores email addresses for subscribers who have signed up to receive the CardCritics&trade; newsletter. For the remaining non-email subscriber traffic, the only Personal Information collected are IP addresses. In many instances, due to the nature of the Personal Information collected, for non-email subscribers, CardCritics&trade; cannot verify consumers’ identities to the degree of certainty required to fulfill requests to know or delete your collected Personal Information. CardCritics&trade; cannot fulfill these requests because email addresses and IP addresses are generally publicly available across various publicly accessibly websites and would not permit CardCritics&trade; to verify Consumers’ identities to a reasonable degree of certainty.</p>



<p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:&nbsp;</p>
