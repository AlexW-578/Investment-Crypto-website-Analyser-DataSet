                    According to Canadian law, an e-signature is legally binding if it communicates the necessary intent to be legally bound to an agreement signed electronically. With the exception of Quebec, all Canadian provinces and territories have enacted legislation based on the Uniform Electronic Commerce Act to promote uniformity in electronic commerce (UECA).
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) 2000 and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) encourage the use of e-signatures when trading. Both ESIGN and UETA emphasize that electronic documents and eSignatures have the same legal standing as traditional methods of contract completion. This demonstrates that electronic documents and signatures cannot be rejected simply because they are electronic. Electronic records and their reproductions are generally admissible into evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Uniform Rules of Evidence.

                        <li><a href="/en/blog/electronic-signatures-vs-digital-signatures" target="_blank">Electronic signature (e-signature) refers to any electronic process that indicates acceptance of an agreement or record.</a> In the United States, the majority of electronic signature solutions fall into this broad category. Electronic signatures use a wide variety of common electronic authentication methods to verify signer identity, such as email, corporate ID, password protection, or a PIN sent to a mobile phone. Proof of signing is demonstrated through a secured process that frequently includes an audit trail and a final tamper-evident digital certificate embedded into the completed signed document.</li>
                        <li><a href="/en/digital-signatures" target="_blank">Digital signatures</a>uses a digital certificate from a trust service provider (TSP), such as a certificate authority (CA), to authenticate a signer’s identity. The digital certificates demonstrate proof of signing by binding the digital certificate associated with each signature to the document using encryption.

                <h4 class="h4">eSignature Legality Summary</h4>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    The U.S. Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act of 2000 established that electronic signatures are legal in every state and U.S. territory where federal law applies. In areas where federal law does not apply, most U.S. states have adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), published by the Uniform Law Commission in 1999. ESIGN serves as the default federal law for transactions involving interstate or international commerce in states that have not adopted UETA or another statute providing alternative procedures for the use of electronic signatures consistent with ESIGN.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">ESIGN was enacted to resolve disputes between different state laws and to standardize the approach to electronic records and signatures in interstate and international commerce. UETA, which has been adopted in most jurisdictions, has substantively similar rules and applies to many transactional situations not covered by ESIGN. As a result, every jurisdiction in the United States has substantially the same rules for the use of electronic signatures.</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) 2000 and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) encourage the use of e-signatures when trading. Both ESIGN and UETA emphasize that electronic documents and eSignatures have the same legal standing as traditional methods of contract completion. This demonstrates that electronic documents and signatures cannot be rejected simply because they are electronic. Electronic records and their reproductions are generally admissible into evidence under the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Uniform Rules of Evidence.</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p"><span class="font-weight-bold">UETA has not been adopted by the state of New
                        York.</span>However, since 2000, under the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA), electronic signatures have been legally binding in New York. This law established the legal equivalence of electronic and handwritten signatures in broad terms.  </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">In<span class="font-weight-bold">New York</span>,, electronic signatures have the same legal validity as handwritten signatures. They are admissible in a court of law as long as they comply with the rules of evidence.</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p font-weight-bold">Under both the ESIGN Act and UETA, electronic signatures are given the same evidentiary weight as handwritten signatures in most cases in the United States.</p>

                    Electronic signatures that comply with the Brazilian Civil Code and MP 2200 are considered to have the same legal effect as a handwritten signature.

Law 14,063/2020 reclassified electronic signatures into three types—standard (SES), advanced (AES), and qualified (QES)—inspired by Regulation (EU) 910/2014 of the European Parliament and Council, which governs electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European internal market (eIDAS Regulation).</p>

                        A standard electronic signature (SES) is the existence of electronic data logically connected to other electronic data (e.g. a document), which is used by the signatory of the electronic data for signature of the document.

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for
                    electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures;
                    electronic (SES), advanced (AES), and qualified (QES) and is. It establishes a legal framework for
                    people, companies (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely
                    access services and execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    To ensure effective enforcement, Germany has additionally adopted a law implementing eIDAS, the so-called Trust Services Act (Vertrauensdienstegesetz or VDG) that aims to facilitate the use of electronic trust services in Germany. The law went into force on 29 July 2017.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    Any type of electronic signature is adequate to conclude a contract if there is no statutory form requirement, as long as both parties have agreed to use an electronic form and no other intention is discernible. It is important to note that a QES has greater evidentiary value than a non-qualified electronic signature when choosing the type of electronic signature to utilize. If a non-QES is utilized, it is the responsibility of the signature holder to show that the document's content has been preserved in its entirety.

                        EU Member States must recognize both qualified and advanced electronic signatures that comply with the required standards. They also must refrain from requesting signatures of a higher level than an advanced electronic signature for cross-border use of online services used by the public sector.<br/>Typically, contracts in Germany are not restricted to any specific format for validity. However, if German law explicitly or implicitly prohibits the use of electronic signatures or mandates the use of the "written form" (which necessitates a qualified electronic signature), then a non-qualified electronic signature may suffice, unless expressly prohibited.

                    The German Civil Code includes the relevant German national regulations (BGB). German law contains many provisions which set forth certain form requirements, particularly the “written form”. The written form is, for example, required by the German Civil Code for canceling a rental contract, the notification of an assignment of rights, or the assignment of rights underlying a mortgage. The BGB contains various “forms” for which specified types of declarations must be in to be valid, for example (i) “written form,” (ii) “text form,” and (iii) “agreed form.” The BGB states that the written form may be replaced by electronic form, unless the statute leads to a different conclusion.

                    The advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate is a type of electronic signature that is unique to Ireland. This type of electronic signature goes beyond the eIDAS Regulation's definition of an Advanced Electronic Signature (AdES), but not quite as far as the definition of a qualified electronic signature (QES).

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    The advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate is most commonly used for documents that must be signed and witnessed. Accordingly, if a document is required to be signed and witnessed using electronic signatures, then both the signatory and witness can sign using an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate. Since this type of signature is unique to Irish law and is not generally used, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of a QES for signatures that require to be witnessed should be accepted by an Irish court. Furthermore, the Act does not restrict documents from being executed by other means in the presence of a witness.

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    Each party signing a document must consent to the use of an e-signature under the 2000 Act. While this consent does not have to be explicit and can be implied or inferred (for example, via contemporaneous emails), it is best practice to acquire express consent between the parties wherever possible (e.g., by including a consent clause in the relevant document).

                    Hungary, a member of the EU, has legally recognized eSignatures since 2001, with The Act on Electronic Signature, established after the implementation of the EU Directive in 1999.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    Due to the legal ambiguity surrounding the concepts of "written form" and "private document with full probative force" under Hungarian law, the use of electronic signatures is generally uncommon in Hungary. Nevertheless, the Hungarian business community is increasingly accepting and using electronic signatures and digital signatures based on certificates.

                        A sA standard electronic signature (SES) is the existence of electronic data logically connected to other electronic data (e.g. a document), which is used by the signatory of the electronic data for signature of the document. Many electronic tools, including passwords, PIN codes and scanned signatures can be regarded as a SES.

                        An advanced electronic signature (AES) must ensure that signatures are uniquely connected to and capable of identifying the signatory. It has to be created using electronic signature creation data that the signatory can, with a high level of confidence, use under their sole control.

                        A qualified electronic signature (QES) is a stricter form of AES and the only signature type given the same legal value as handwritten signatures.

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures:<br/>
                    <ul class="green-listing">
                        <li>Electronic (SES)</li>
                        <li>Advanced (AES) </li>
                        <li>Qualified (QES)</li>
                    </ul><br/>
                    It establishes a legal framework for people, companies (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely access services and execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    The Hungarian Civil Code states that a legal declaration can only be considered valid if it is made in the exact form that is required by law or by the parties' agreement. In addition, if the written form is necessary, the contract is regarded as legitimate if:
                </p>
                <ul class="green-listing">
                    <li>at least the key points of the statement are executed in writing; or</li>
                    <li>the person making the statement has signed using a handwritten signature, unless otherwise specified by law; or</li>
                    <li>it is possible to retrieve the unaltered information from the document, identify the person making the legal statement, and identify the time when the legal statement was made</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    According to the general view in Hungary, the requirement for the written form may be satisfied by a qualified electronic signature (QES) or an advanced electronic signature (AdES). However, there are court decisions that have accepted simple (or basic) electronic signatures as the written form. Hence, emphasizing that the Hungarian courts will determine whether an electronic signature on a legal statement meets the requirement of the written form on a case-by-case basis.

                    Under Swiss procedural law as governed by the Swiss Civil Procedure Code, Swiss courts are free in
                    their appraisal of the evidence presented to them, and there is no preference by law for certain
                    forms of evidence. As a result, an electronic signature cannot be denied legal effect and
                    admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings solely because it is in electronic form or does not
                    meet the requirements for a QES.

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    However, if a SES or AES is used, the holder of the signature must demonstrate that the integrity of
                    the document's content was preserved. Furthermore, while SES, AES, and RES may not be denied legal
                    effect and admissibility as evidence, it does not necessarily mean that they will receive the same
                    legal treatment as a handwritten signature.

This is stated in Chapter 35 Section 1 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, but more evidence may be required to support it).

                    required (Article 1405 of Civil Code). Unless the legislation specifies a specific format

                    eSignatures are legally valid and admissible in a court of law. Russia has legally accepted electronic signatures since the Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 63-FZ “On Electronic Signature” was passed on 6th April 2011. In accordance with Russian law, a written signature is not necessarily required for a contract to be enforceable - contracts are generally valid if legally competent parties reach an agreement, whether they agree in a physical paper document and in some instances electronically or verbally (Clauses 158 - 160 of Russian Civil Code). To substantiate a valid contract, parties sometimes have to present evidence (a document signed with an e-signature) in court.

                    The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures:

                <p class="lead custom-p">
                    Unless a contract is signed using a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) as defined in the eIDAS Regulation, the holder of the electronic signature is responsible for proving that the contract was concluded electronically and that the signatories had the actual or apparent authority to enter into the contract in question. Furthermore, courts have only an a posteriori authority over whether or not electronic signatures can be used.

                <p class="lead custom-p">The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures:
                   <ul class="green-listing">
    <li>Electronic (SES)</li>
    <li>Advanced (AES)</li>
    <li>Qualified (QES) </li>
</ul><br/>
It establishes a legal framework for people, companies (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely access services and execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.<br/>In general, electronic signatures are widely used in Belgium, facilitating contracting processes in a digital environment. However, with a few exceptions, the use of certificate-based digital signatures is still evolving because they are not yet required by Belgian law. Because no one can be forced to contract electronically in Belgium, the option for a handwritten signature should always be available.

<br/>In addition to the eIDAS Regulation, the following laws govern e-signatures in Belgium:
<ul class="green-listing">
    <li>
        The Belgian Economic Code, which implements the eIDAS Regulation; and
    </li>
    <li>
        The Belgian Civil Code, which helps harmonize the Belgian Economic Code with the eIDAS Regulation.

                <p class="lead custom-p">In Austria, the use and acceptance of electronic and certificate-based digital signatures are common and have grown in recent years. Certain professionals, such as lawyers and notaries, are required to make electronic submissions to courts, which necessitates electronic authentication. Electronic signatures are also becoming more common in everyday transactions. It should be noted, however, that in Austria, a person cannot be forced to contract electronically; the option to use a handwritten signature should always be available.</p>

                <p class="lead custom-p">In addition to eIDAS, the Signature and Trust Services Act (Signatur- & Vertrauensdienstegesetz, or SVG) is the most important source of law in Austria concerning electronic signatures. The Federal Ministers of Economic Affairs and Justice issued the Signature and Trust Services Ordinance (Signatur- & Vertrauensdienseteverordnung) on the basis of the SVG, which specifies the requirements for: i) the application and issuance of qualified certificates; (ii) trust service providers; (iii) certificate databases; and (iv) supervisory body fees.</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">Section 886 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch or ABGB) states that qualified electronic signatures (QES) satisfy the requirement of written form under Section 4 Para 1 of the SVG. Furthermore, section 294 of the Austrian Civil Procedure Code (Zivilprozessordnung or ZPO) states that documents signed by the issuer provide full proof that the contents of the document originate with the issuer. Because QES are considered to be the same as a handwritten signature, this section also applies to qualified electronic signatures. As a result, in Austria, any party contesting the authenticity of such a document bears the burden of proof.</p>

                <p class="lead custom-p">In Denmark, whether a contract can be enforced after being signed electronically largely depends on the "will of the parties" and if that will can be established in court. Danish courts are often free to evaluate any evidence that is brought before them. The signed document and the correspondence between the parties may be presented in order to demonstrate the authenticity of an electronic signature. As a result, electronic signatures that include identity validation, such as electronic signatures backed by digital certificates, will normally be considered to provide stronger evidence of validity.

                <p class="lead custom-p">The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust
                    services
                    for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures;
                    electronic
                    (SES), advanced (AES), and qualified (QES) and is. It establishes a legal framework for people,
                    companies
                    (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely access services
                    and
                    execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.<br/>
                    In Denmark, the following documents are directly enforceable before the Danish Enforcement Courts only if they are signed with an Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) or a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) with a security level deemed “substantial” or “high” under Article 8 of the eIDAS Regulation or the Danish OCES standard:
                    <ul class="green-listing">
                        <li>Out-of-court settlements;</li>
                        <li>Instruments of debt explicitly stating that the document can be used as a basis for enforcement proceedings without a court order or other enforcement basis;</li>
                        <li>Agreements reserving ownership until payment is made (e.g., a conditional sale).</li>
                    </ul><br/>
                    Electronic signatures are frequently employed with Nets DanID's widely accepted Danish identity verification technology NemID. A NemID can only be obtained by a Danish citizen. The advantage of NemID is that it is designed to provide a secure validation of identity of the person signing the document. When engaging with Danish individuals, banks and government agencies typically use NemID. In addition, MitID is the national Danish eID and complies with the eIDAS regulation as a qualified trust service. MitID is the new common secure login method for the Internet. Unlike NemID, MitID is used solely for authentication, while digital signatures are handled within the NemLog-in infrastructure. Both MitID and NemLog-in3 are managed by the Danish Agency for Digitalisation (Digitaliseringsstyrelsen).<br/>
                    Denmark also implements several standards in line with the requirements of the eIDAS regulation, including the Public Certificates for Electronic Services (OCES standard) and the National Standard for the Security Level of Identities (NSIS standard). These standards are particularly relevant to the NemID and MitID solutions. The NSIS standard aligns with the security levels outlined in Article 8 of the eIDAS regulation.

                <p class="lead custom-p"><span class="font-weight-bold">UK eIDAS</span> eIDAS also recognizes two types of digital signatures: advanced electronic signatures (AdES) and qualified electronic signatures (QES). English law is generally conducive to executing documents with an electronic signature and does not require a digital signature. The use of QES is generally reserved for cross-border transactions or other transactions where the parties desire a higher degree of ID verification.
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">Article 25 of UK eIDAS provides that an electronic signature cannot be denied legal effectiveness solely because of its electronic nature.</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">The statute also provides that electronic signatures are admissible as evidence in legal proceedings. Section 7(1) of the ECA mirrors the admissibility provision in UK eIDAS:</p>
                <p class="lead custom-p font-italic"><q>In any legal proceedings, an electronic signature incorporated into or logically associated with a particular electronic communication or particular electronic data, and the certification by any person of such a signature, shall each be admissible in evidence in relation to any question as to the authenticity of the communication or data or as to the integrity of the communication or data.</q></p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">The Law Commission was concerned that legal uncertainties were impeding the use of electronic signatures and e-signing platforms. In September 2019, following a lengthy consultation period, the Law Commission published a report on the  <span><a
                            href="https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/electronic-execution-of-documents/"
                            target="_blank">Electronic execution of documents.</a></span>The findings in the Report were endorsed by the UK government in March 2020.<br/>Within the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement 2020 (TCA), a pivotal assurance stands: neither party may discriminate against electronic signatures and electronic documents merely because of their electronic nature. This clause embodies a commitment to digital parity, ensuring that electronic forms are treated on par with their traditional counterparts. However, the TCA's definition of electronic signatures differs from the standards outlined in EU eIDAS and UK eIDAS. The TCA introduces a stringent criterion for 'data integrity,' signifying a heightened standard for electronic signatures.<br/><ul class="green-listing"><li>If a QES (and other qualified trust services) is issued by a QTSP in any EU member state, it will still be recognized as a QES in the UK. </li><li>UK eIDAS ensures the reciprocal recognition of electronic signatures and related trust services by aligning its technical standards and specifications with those defined in EU eIDAS. This harmonization ensures that electronic signature platforms and trust service providers operating within the EU can continue to offer their services to customers in the UK. </li></ul></p>

                <p class="lead custom-p">The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures: 
                  <ul class="green-listing">
                    <li>Electronic (SES),</li>
                    <li>Advanced (AES), and</li>
                    <li>Qualified (QES)</li>
                  </ul><br/>
                  It establishes a legal framework for people, companies (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely access services and execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.<br/>
                  The Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic is a designated supervisory body pursuant to article 17(2) of Regulation (EU) 910/2014. Ministry is also the body responsible for establishing, maintaining and publishing the national Trusted Lists pursuant to article 22(3) of Regulation (EU) 910/2014.<br/>The most notable change is an amendment to the Act on Trust Services for Electronic Transactions, effective from 1 July 2022, which introduced the possibility of notarizing a signature in electronic form (i.e., by electronic signature of a notary). Additionally, since September 2021, electronic notarial deeds have been permitted, allowing a notary to draft these documents based on the remote (electronic) identification of the signatory.<br/>These amendments have significantly reduced the range of legal acts (typically contracts) that require written form and handwritten signatures. They have enabled the use of electronic signatures in almost all instances where Czech law requires either a notarized (verified) signature or a notarial deed, as opposed to a plain written form.

                <p class="lead custom-p">The eIDAS regulation, an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market, defines three types of e-signatures:
                    •	Electronic (SES) 
                    •	Advanced (AES) 
                    •	Qualified (QES)
                    It establishes a legal framework for people, companies (in particular small to mid-size enterprises) and public administrations to safely access services and execute transactions digitally across all the EU member states.
                    
                </p>
                <p class="lead custom-p">In Portugal, eSignatures and certificate-based digital signatures are frequently used, which facilitates the contracting process in a digital environment. Although qualified electronic signatures (QES) are frequently utilized for public procurement and various e-government services, their application in the business community is still evolving. As a result, the regulations governing electronic signatures are familiar to Portugal's administrative courts (e-signatures). </p>
