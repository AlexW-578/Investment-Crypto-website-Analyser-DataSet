Amounts due to Partners from Merchants as the result of Partner using the Shopify Billing API are excluded from the term Fees. The revenue sharing plans applicable to the different types of Referral Partners are set out in <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms#part-b">Part B.</a> The revenue sharing plans applicable to the different types of Developers are set out in <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms#part-c">Part C.</a></p><h4 class="text-t6">3.2. Payment</h4><aside>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p><strong>Fees owing to the Partner under the Reference Plan, App Plan, Theme Plan, Bounty Plan and Channel Program will be paid in accordance with this section. If a Developer does not use the Shopify Billing API, they must submit payments to Shopify directly.</strong></p></aside>

<ol>
<li>Fees due to Partner under the Reference Plan will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of payment from the Merchant, for each month that the Referred Merchant Store is active. Fees due to Partner under the Bounty Plan will be calculated by Shopify once per month upon receipt of subscription revenue from the Merchant for two consecutive months.</li>
<li>Shopify distributes Fees owing to its Partners and amounts due to Partner from Merchants where the Partner uses the Shopify Billing API twice per calendar month (each such period, a <strong>“Payment Period”</strong>). The first Payment Period occurs during the first half of the month, and the second Payment Period occurs during the second half of the month. The Fees described in Section 3.2.1 will be paid in either the first Payment Period or the second Payment Period, depending on the date that the Fee was calculated by Shopify. Where the Fees owing to Partner are greater than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, the Fees will be paid to Partner. If the Fees owing to Partner are less than USD $25 at the end of any Payment Period, Shopify will be entitled to withhold payment of Fees until the end of the next Payment Period in which the balance of unpaid Fees owing to Partner from any previous Payment Period and Fees owing to Partner under the current Payment Period are USD $25 or more.</li>
<li>Any Fees payable by one Party to another Party that arise as the result of any activity under this Agreement shall be exclusive of Taxes. Such Taxes are in addition to any Fees.

Tax exemption will only apply from and after the date we receive such certificate. Partners are responsible for all applicable Taxes that arise from or as a result of any activities under this Agreement or with respect to Partners dealings with a Merchant. If Taxes are not collected by Shopify in respect of Fees or a Partner transaction with a Merchant, Partner is responsible for determining if Taxes are payable on such transaction, and if so, paying Taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
Any Fees owing to Shopify by Partner shall be free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any withholding taxes of any taxing jurisdictions. If withholding taxes must be withheld from the Fees owing to Shopify, such Fees shall be increased such that the amount received by Shopify is the same as it would have been if no withholding taxes were withheld.</li>
<li>Shopify will issue You an invoice for any Fees Shopify is charging You. Shopify will prepare an invoice, on Your behalf, to Shopify for any Fees that Shopify pays to you for referral activities. Invoices are generated when a payout is processed. You can&#39;t view invoices for pending transactions.</li>
<li>For App Developers who obtain Shopify’s express written permission to forego use of the Shopify Billing API, the App Developer will submit payments due under the App Plan to Shopify monthly by way of wire transfer or Automated Clearing House (ACH). Any such payments made by the App Developers to Shopify will be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any withholding taxes of any taxing jurisdictions. If withholding taxes must be withheld from any payment to Shopify, the App Developers shall increase the payment to Shopify such that the amount received by Shopify is the same as it would have been if no withholding taxes were withheld. The App Developer is responsible for contacting <a href="mailto:app-commissions@shopify.com">app-commissions@shopify.com</a> to obtain the necessary banking information to execute the transfer. If the balance owed to Shopify is less than USD $1,000, App Developer may defer payment until the outstanding balance at the end of a payment period is USD $1,000 or more.

This may establish a “material connection” according to FTC rules, which creates an obligation for Partner to provide disclosure to consumers.</li>
<li>Full compliance with these guidelines requires, among other things, that (a) Partner clearly and conspicuously disclose that Partner is being compensated for referring Referred Merchants to Shopify, and (b) Partner not engage in misleading or deceptive advertising.

<ol>
<li>The <strong>“Reference Plan”</strong> is a revenue sharing plan applicable to Partners that introduce Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner’s Partner Dashboard. Under the Reference Plan, a Partner is entitled to a percentage of certain revenue received from such Referred Merchant, to be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion, with Shopify being entitled to the remaining percentage. A description of the current revenue share percentages applicable to Partners and amounts eligible to be included in the Partner’s revenue share is available at: <a href="https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn">help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn</a>. Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share applicable to the Reference Plan, and any ongoing obligations to receive revenue share from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog, or in the Partner Dashboard.</li>
<li>The <strong>“Bounty Plan”</strong> is a bonus plan that pays Partner a fixed, one-time payment (<strong>“Bounty”</strong>) when the Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant using the Partner Affiliate Link. The Bounty Plan is not applicable in respect of the Shopify Plus plan. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Shopify, under the Bounty Plan, when a Referred Merchant is referred by a Partner to a Shopify plan (other than Shopify Plus), Partner will receive a fixed one-time Bounty of two hundred percent (200%) of one-month’s subscription revenue received from such Referred Merchant. Any Bounty payable to a Partner will be paid in two parts. The first half of the Bounty will be paid within 30 days after the Referred Merchant pays Shopify their first monthly subscription fee. The second half of the bounty will be paid within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the first half of the Bounty was paid. The Bounty Plan may also apply where a Referred Merchant is introduced to Shopify by more than one Referral Partner. See <a href="https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn">help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn</a> for more details. Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share amounts applicable to the Bounty Plan from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard.</li>
<li>For each Referral Merchant, Partner will be entitled to receive Fees from either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan, but not both. Where Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner&#39;s Dashboard, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Reference Plan. Where a Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through the Referral Partner’s Affiliate Link, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Bounty Plan. Whether the Partner receives Fees in respect of a Referred Merchant under either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan is at Shopify’s sole and absolute discretion. To learn more about the Reference Plan and Bounty Plan, please visit <a href="https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/how-to-earn">help.shopify.com/partners/how-to-earn</a>.</li>
<li>Shopify reserves the right to (i) demand and receive information from Referral Partners about any Referred Merchant, including but not limited to information with respect to traffic sources and methods used to acquire the Referred Merchant, and (ii) assess the legitimacy and qualification of such Referred Merchant for the purposes of determining whether a Fee is payable for such Referred Merchant.

A Development Store is deemed to become a Merchant Store upon the earlier of: (a) the payment of monthly subscription fees for the store by either the VAP or Merchant; and (b) the transfer by the VAP of ownership of the Development Store to the Merchant, at which time the VAP or the Merchant’s use of the Merchant Store will be subject to the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/terms">Shopify Terms of Service</a>.</p><h3 class="text-t5">6. Relationship between VAP and Merchant</h3><p>The services provided by a VAP to a Merchant are the responsibility of the VAP and not of Shopify. It is the VAP’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the VAP and Merchant for the services to be provided by the VAP to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the VAP, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion. In the event of a dispute between the VAP and the Merchant, Shopify is not obligated to intervene in any such dispute. Under no circumstances will Shopify be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, extraordinary, exemplary or other damages whatsoever, that result from or relate to the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant by Shopify, or the VAP’s relationship with any Merchant. These limitations will apply even if Shopify has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitations will apply to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p><h2 id="part-c" class="text-t4"> Part C - Additional Terms Applicable to Developers</h2><p>This Part C contains terms applicable to Developers generally.

<li><strong>Privacy &amp; Data Usage</strong>. Use Merchant data in any way that is not explicitly and accurately disclosed to the Merchant. Shopify may request and Payments Developer will provide a description of the manner in which Payments Developer collects and uses Merchant data. Payments Developer must provide Shopify with any changes or updates to how they collect and use data in connection with their Payments Application. Payments Developer acknowledges that Shopify may share a summary of how data is collected and shared by the Payments Application in our communications with Shopify Merchants.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="text-t6">6. Termination, Suspension and Removal from the Payments Platform</h4><p>Shopify may at its sole discretion remove your Payments Application from Shopify’s public list of payment gateways, suspend or terminate your access to the Payments Platform and your participation in Shopify’s payments ecosystem, or take any other action that we deem necessary for the violation of any clause in this Section “Additional Terms Applicable to Payments Developers.” For the avoidance of doubt, this Section does not preclude the termination rights set forth in Section 4 “Termination” of this Agreement.</p><h3 class="text-t5">C.6. Additional Terms Applicable to Blockchain Developers</h3><h4 class="text-t6">1. App Requirements</h4><ol>
<li>Blockchain Developers are permitted to develop Blockchain Applications that integrate blockchain-based functionalities and the Service. Applications that constitute both a Blockchain Application and another type of Application (including but not limited to a Payments Application) are subject to the terms of this section as well as the terms that govern that other type of Application.</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong>. All Blockchain Applications are subject to Shopify&#39;s review and acceptance to ensure compliance with our guidelines, API documentation, and other standards that we deem necessary to protect the integrity of Shopify’s blockchain ecosystem. Shopify retains the right to remove a Blockchain Application from the Shopify App Store at any time for any reason. Blockchain Applications may only be distributed in the Shopify App Store.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchain Apps APIs</strong>. Blockchain Developers must comply with the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/legal/api-terms">Shopify API Terms</a>. To help guide you through the development of your Blockchain Application, we maintain a list of requirements under <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/blockchain">Blockchain Developer Guidelines</a> that Blockchain Developers must follow. Every Blockchain Developer must adhere to these guidelines and every Blockchain Application must meet the technical and other specifications that it describes. Blockchain Developers may only use the Blockchain Apps APIs as specified in the <a href="https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/blockchain">Blockchain Developer Guidelines</a> and may not use any other Shopify APIs unless granted permission from Shopify. Blockchain Developer acknowledges that Shopify will update the Blockchain Apps APIs at its discretion. It is the Blockchain Developer’s responsibility to install any updated version of the APIs.</li>
<li><strong>Minimum Support Commitment</strong>. Blockchain Applications must provide industry standard service levels to merchants. The Blockchain Application must at a minimum be operational and available on a twenty-four hour, seven days a week (24x7) basis at least 99.95% of the time in any measurement period. Blockchain Applications must provide servicing support to all Merchants and are required to provide Shopify with an email address which can be used by Merchants to contact the Blockchain Application directly for support.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="text-t6">2. Risk, Fraud &amp; Compliance</h4><ol>
<li><strong>Maintain a Risk &amp; Fraud Program</strong>. Blockchain Applications are responsible for monitoring and managing risk and fraud. If the Blockchain Application is being used by what Shopify deems as an unreasonably high percentage of Merchants who are engaging in fraudulent or high risk behavior, as determined in Shopify’s sole discretion, Blockchain Application agrees to collaborate with Shopify to implement and develop preventive measures to mitigate such risk. If Blockchain Application fails to collaborate with Shopify, or fails to take additional steps to reduce risk and fraud in a manner that we deem appropriate, we may take governance action against the Blockchain Application.</li>
<li><strong>Requests for and Sharing of Information</strong>. You agree to share certain information about you and your Blockchain Application with Shopify. This includes you sharing information: (i) about blockchain transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes or as may be otherwise requested from time to time; (ii) that Shopify deems necessary, in our sole discretion, for the management and maintenance of Shopify’s ecosystem; (iii) that Shopify deems necessary, in our sole discretion, to conduct our risk management process.</li>
<li><strong>Compliance with Applicable Laws, Regulations &amp; Standards</strong>. Blockchain Developer must comply with any terms, guidelines or approval processes required pursuant to any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="text-t6">3. Unauthorized and Prohibited Activities</h4><ol>
<li><strong>Fungible Tokens</strong>. Blockchain Applications cannot mint, support, sell, transfer or modify any form of fungible tokens unless they have been approved as a Payments Developer and Payments Application.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Sales and Royalties</strong>. Blockchain Applications cannot support any secondary sales of non-fungible tokens, or the creation, minting or sale of any non-fungible tokens that contain secondary-level or transferable royalties.</li>
<li><strong>Securities and Other Financial Instruments</strong>. Blockchain Applications cannot facilitate the minting, sale or marketing of non-fungible tokens that may be classified as securities or other forms of regulated financial instruments.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and Data Usage</strong>. Blockchain Applications cannot write or store any personal data on-chain, or directly within the blocks of blockchain. Blockchain Applications must not use Merchant data in any way that is not explicitly and accurately disclosed to the Merchant. Blockchain Developer must provide Shopify with any changes or updates to how they collect and use data in connection with their Blockchain Application. Blockchain Developer acknowledges that Shopify may share a summary of how data is collected and shared by the Blockchain Application in our communications with Merchants.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="text-t6">4. Termination, Suspension and Removal</h4><p>Shopify may at its sole discretion remove your Blockchain Application from Shopify’s public list of payment gateways, suspend or terminate your access and your participation in Shopify’s blockchain ecosystem, or take any other action that we deem necessary for the violation of any clause in this Section “Additional Terms Applicable to Blockchain Developers.” For the avoidance of doubt, this Section does not preclude the termination rights set forth in Part A, Section 4 “Termination” of this Agreement.</p><h4 class="text-t6">5. Indemnification</h4><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the indemnification obligations outlined in this Section C.6.5 shall apply exclusively to Blockchain Developers and their activities as related to Blockchain Applications, thereby replacing Part A, Sections 8.2 and 8.3, of the Agreement in such instances. Where an App Developer’s Application classifies as both a Blockchain Application and another type of Application (including without limitation a Payments Application), the indemnification obligations in this Section C.6.5 shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, Part A, Sections 8.2 and 8.3, of the Agreement shall continue to govern and apply to non-Blockchain Developers and activities that are not specifically related to Blockchain Applications. This Section C.6.5 shall survive any termination or expiration of the Partner Agreement.</p><ol>
<li><strong>Partner Indemnification</strong>. Partner agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and upon Shopify’s request, assume the defense of, Shopify and any Shopify Related Entities and the directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents thereof (each, an “<strong>Indemnified Party</strong>”, and collectively, the “<strong>Indemnified Parties</strong>”), with respect to any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, losses, or liability, whether or not foreseeable, including but not limited to any costs of investigation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and court costs (collectively, “<strong>claims</strong>”), arising from or relating to the following: (a) Partner’s breach of any representation, warranty, obligation or covenant under this Agreement; (b) Partner’s negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any warranty, condition, representation, indemnity or guarantee relating to Shopify and Shopify Related Entities granted by Partner to any Merchant, prospective Partner or other third party; (d) Partner’s use of the Shopify API (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and Shopify Billing API); (e) Partner’s breach of any term of this Agreement (including any documents it incorporates by reference) or a Merchant Agreement; (f) any violation of any law or regulation by Partner; (g) any third party claim that Partner’s products or services, including without limitation any Application, Theme, or Channel Platform, does not comply with any law or regulation or infringe the rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, of any person; (h) Partner Taxes, including any audits or penalties related thereto; (i) the performance, nonperformance or improper or defective performance of Partner’s products or services, including without limitation, any Application or Theme or Channel Platform; and (j) Partner’s relationship with any Merchant. The Indemnified Party’s recovery under this agreement shall not be subject to a duty to mitigate any losses suffered.</li>
<li><strong>Notice of Indemnification</strong>. In claiming any indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will promptly provide Partner with written notice of any claim which the Indemnified Party believes falls within the scope of the indemnifications provided under this Agreement. Failure to give such prompt written notice shall not relieve Partner of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that Partner forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Partner may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, provided that, unless Partner has been asked to assume control of the defense under the section above, Indemnified Party will control such defense and all negotiations relative to the settlement of any such claim. For any claim in relation to which Indemnified Party has assumed control of the defense, Partner shall fully cooperate with Indemnified Party in connection therewith and shall reimburse Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs properly incurred in defending against the claim (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) and remain responsible to Indemnified Party for any claims indemnified under the section above. For any claim in relation to which Partner has assumed control of the defense, Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with Partner in connection therewith and may employ, at any time, separate counsel to represent it; provided, that Partner is responsible for the costs and expenses of such separate counsel. Partner shall not enter into any settlement or agreement with any person that affects the Indemnified Party’s rights or binds the Indemnified Party in any way without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="part-d" class="text-t4"> Part D – Additional Terms Applicable to the Partner Directory and the Shopify Tiered Partner Program</h2><p>In addition to the terms applicable to all Referral Partners, as set out in <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms#part-b">Part B</a>, the following terms apply to the Partner Directory and Partners accepted into the Tiered Partner Program.</p><h3 class="text-t5">1. Partner Directory</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Directory</strong>. Tiered Partner Program members may be listed in the Partner Directory. Merchants may contact Partners listed in the Partner Directory.</li>
<li><strong>Communications</strong>. Partner acknowledges and agrees that Shopify receives and can review all communications exchanged via the Partner Directory or in any reply emails that originate within the Partner Directory (directly or indirectly) between Partner and Merchant. As a participant in the Partner Directory, Partner consents to being contacted by Merchants at the email address provided by Partner to Shopify.</li>
<li><strong>Relationship</strong>. The services provided by a Partner via the Partner Directory are the responsibility of the Partner and not of Shopify. It is the Partner’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the Partner and Merchant for the services to be provided by the Partner to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the Partner, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion.</li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong>. Merchants are able to submit reviews and ratings on their experience with a Partner. A Partner’s rating is calculated based on reviews posted by Merchants. Partners may not solicit or permit reviews that are fake, inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, being used improperly for commercial gain, posted in exchange for a financial or other gain, posted multiple times (whether from the same or more than one account), misleading as to the reviewer&#39;s identity or their connection to the Partner being reviewed, or reviews that contain or link to prohibited or illegal content. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful and trustworthy. Shopify reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in respect of a Partner engaged in any of this behaviour, including the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Merchant reviews.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-t5">2. Tiered Partner Program</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Designation</strong>. From time to time Shopify may designate certain of its Partners as a <strong>“Tiered Partner”</strong>, to be listed on the <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/directory">Shopify Partner Directory</a>. The granting of a Tiered Partner designation is entirely within Shopify’s discretion.</li>
<li><strong>Revenue Sharing Plan</strong>. The revenue sharing plans for the Partner Program are set out in Parts B and C of this Agreement, unless otherwise modified in a Partner addendum.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-t5">3. Removal of Designation</h3><aside>

<h3 class="text-t5">Which means</h3><p><strong>Shopify can designate Partner as a Tiered Partner in the Tiered Partner Program resources. These designations are at Shopify’s discretion, and can be removed at any time and for any reason. If Shopify removes the designation, the Partner must immediately stop referring to itself as a “Shopify Tiered Partner”.</strong></p></aside>

<p>Shopify may remove or revise the Tiered Partner designation at any time and for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, effective immediately upon notice to the relevant Tiered Partner. Upon notice of the revocation of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will remove Partner from the Tiered Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately cease referring to itself as a Tiered Partner on any Website or otherwise. Upon notice of a revision of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will update references to Partner’s tier within the Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately update any references to its tier within the Partner Program on any Website or otherwise.</p><h2 id="part-e" class="text-t4"> Part E – Additional Terms Applicable to Ads in the Shopify App Store</h2><p>In addition to the terms applicable to Developers elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms apply to Ads.</p><h3 class="text-t5">1. Fees</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Auctions</strong>. The price Developers pay for an Ad, and whether or not the Developer wins an auction for an Ad to be displayed, will be based upon (1) the daily budget set by the Developer in the Partner Dashboard, (2) the amount bid for various keywords and (3) a confidential relevance score created by Shopify to ensure that Merchants and other users see Ads that are relevant and valuable to them. Shopify will solely determine which Ads will be shown and nothing in this Agreement guarantees that Developer will win any auctions to display their Ads, have their Ads displayed or get any impressions or clicks. All bids entered by Developer are binding offers from Developer which may be accepted or rejected by Shopify in its sole discretion.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing</strong>. The Developer will be charged for an Ad on a cost per click basis.</li>
<li><strong>Payments</strong>. The Developer will provide a payment method to Shopify and hereby authorizes Shopify to automatically charge such payment method for Ads purchased in compliance with this Agreement. Developer may not set-off any of its payments for Ads against any other amounts due to Developer under this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Shopify, Developer’s payment method may be charged by Shopify (1) each time the Developer reaches $100 in Ad fees, including if necessary, multiple times per day, or (2) every thirty (30) days, whichever comes first.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-t5">2. Ads</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Content</strong>. Most of the content of the Ads will be generated by Shopify and will not be customizable by the Developer. Ad names and all other content provided by Developer must comply with Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy. You hereby grant Shopify a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid license to store, use, reproduce and display any Ad names or other content provided by Developer for purposes of delivering the Ads and managing the service herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a transfer, license or assignment of any intellectual property rights.</li>
<li><strong>Keywords</strong>. While the Developer may request certain triggering keywords for the Ads and negative triggering keywords as well, Shopify may prohibit and block the use of any keywords in its discretion. If broad keywords are selected by Developer, the actual triggering keywords implemented will be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-t5">3. Reporting</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Reporting</strong>. Shopify will provide the Developer with access to reporting through the Partner Dashboard. Shopify’s reporting is the sole and definitive measure of payment obligations for the Ads. All data in such reporting, and all usage and conversion data generated as a result of the Ads, is owned by Shopify. Developer may only use the reporting and metrics provided by Shopify to Developer for the performance and management of this Agreement and for its internal business purposes. Such reporting may not be shared by Developer with any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its accountants and financial advisors).</li>
<li><strong>Disputes</strong>. In the event that Developer disputes any reporting, Developer must notify Shopify in writing within seven (7) days of the date the report is first made available to Developer by Shopify, otherwise the Developer acknowledges the accuracy of such reporting and waives any claims based upon such reporting thereafter.</li>
<li><strong>Fraud</strong>. The Developer agrees not to engage in, encourage, assist or authorize any third party to generate fraudulent traffic with respect to the Ads of any party, including but not limited to, through the use of bots or other means.</li>

The Federal Trade Commission in the United States (**“FTC”**) has guidelines for governing endorsements and testimonials. These rules are aimed at increasing transparency between endorsers and consumers. As a member of the Partner Program with Shopify, Partner receives compensation for the Referred Merchant referrals made to Shopify. This may establish a “material connection” according to FTC rules, which creates an obligation for Partner to provide disclosure to consumers.\\n2. Full compliance with these guidelines requires, among other things, that (a) Partner clearly and conspicuously disclose that Partner is being compensated for referring Referred Merchants to Shopify, and (b) Partner not engage in misleading or deceptive advertising. For further information Partner should refer to the statement released by the FTC regarding these guidelines.\\n\\n### 2. Revenue Sharing Plans for Referral Partners\\n\\n\u003caside\u003e\\n\\n### Which means\\n\\n**Referral Partners cannot buy search engine advertising, trademarks or domain names that mention or use “Shopify” or other Shopify logos and cannot engage in any fraudulent, spam or low quality marketing activities.**\\n\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\\n\\n1. The **“Reference Plan”** is a revenue sharing plan applicable to Partners that introduce Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner’s Partner Dashboard. Under the Reference Plan, a Partner is entitled to a percentage of certain revenue received from such Referred Merchant, to be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion, with Shopify being entitled to the remaining percentage. A description of the current revenue share percentages applicable to Partners and amounts eligible to be included in the Partner’s revenue share is available at: [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn). Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share applicable to the Reference Plan, and any ongoing obligations to receive revenue share from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog, or in the Partner Dashboard.\\n2. The **“Bounty Plan”** is a bonus plan that pays Partner a fixed, one-time payment (**“Bounty”**) when the Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant using the Partner Affiliate Link. The Bounty Plan is not applicable in respect of the Shopify Plus plan. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Shopify, under the Bounty Plan, when a Referred Merchant is referred by a Partner to a Shopify plan (other than Shopify Plus), Partner will receive a fixed one-time Bounty of two hundred percent (200%) of one-month’s subscription revenue received from such Referred Merchant. Any Bounty payable to a Partner will be paid in two parts. The first half of the Bounty will be paid within 30 days after the Referred Merchant pays Shopify their first monthly subscription fee. The second half of the bounty will be paid within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in which the first half of the Bounty was paid. The Bounty Plan may also apply where a Referred Merchant is introduced to Shopify by more than one Referral Partner. See [help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/partners/getting-started/how-to-earn) for more details. Shopify reserves the right to revise the revenue share amounts applicable to the Bounty Plan from time to time, at its sole discretion, upon reasonable prior notice to Partner. Such notice will be provided by email, posting a notice on the Shopify blog or in the Partner Dashboard.\\n3. For each Referral Merchant, Partner will be entitled to receive Fees from either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan, but not both. Where Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through a Development Store associated with the Referral Partner's Dashboard, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Reference Plan. Where a Partner introduces Shopify to a Referred Merchant through the Referral Partner’s Affiliate Link, the Partner will be entitled to receive Fees in accordance with the Bounty Plan. Whether the Partner receives Fees in respect of a Referred Merchant under either the Reference Plan or the Bounty Plan is at Shopify’s sole and absolute discretion. To learn more about the Reference Plan and Bounty Plan, please visit [help.shopify.com/partners/how-to-earn](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/how-to-earn).\\n4. Shopify reserves the right to (i) demand and receive information from Referral Partners about any Referred Merchant, including but not limited to information with respect to traffic sources and methods used to acquire the Referred Merchant, and (ii) assess the legitimacy and qualification of such Referred Merchant for the purposes of determining whether a Fee is payable for such Referred Merchant.

Payments Developer will, upon Shopify’s reasonable request, deliver reasonable evidence to Shopify of Payments Developer’s compliance with PCI-DSS.\\n\\n#### 5. Unauthorized \u0026 Prohibited Activities\\n\\nA Payments Developer and Payments Application will not engage in the activities listed below.\\n\\n1. **Fees**. Refer to any fee, expense or other cost as a Shopify fee on its invoices to Merchants, or offer any low promotional or introductory rate without express written disclosure of the offer terms, including, but not limited to, the offer period and the increased Merchant rate following the expiration of the promotional or introductory offer.\\n2. **Share access**. Redistribute, share, sell or generate revenue from sharing access with other developers to Payments Platform, without Shopify’s approval. The access provided to the Payments Apps APIs is to be used only by the Payments Developer to which access was granted.\\n3. **Manipulate performance**. Create fake or fraudulent Merchants, orders or sales in order to portray a higher volume of traffic.\\n4. **Use of vaulted or store credit cards**. Store payment credentials for any use other than for the transaction that the credentials were provided and for the transaction and services that Shopify has approved the Payments Application to conduct.\\n5. **Privacy \u0026 Data Usage**. Use Merchant data in any way that is not explicitly and accurately disclosed to the Merchant. Shopify may request and Payments Developer will provide a description of the manner in which Payments Developer collects and uses Merchant data. Payments Developer must provide Shopify with any changes or updates to how they collect and use data in connection with their Payments Application. Payments Developer acknowledges that Shopify may share a summary of how data is collected and shared by the Payments Application in our communications with Shopify Merchants.\\n\\n#### 6. Termination, Suspension and Removal from the Payments Platform\\n\\nShopify may at its sole discretion remove your Payments Application from Shopify’s public list of payment gateways, suspend or terminate your access to the Payments Platform and your participation in Shopify’s payments ecosystem, or take any other action that we deem necessary for the violation of any clause in this Section “Additional Terms Applicable to Payments Developers.” For the avoidance of doubt, this Section does not preclude the termination rights set forth in Section 4 “Termination” of this Agreement.\\n\\n### C.6. Additional Terms Applicable to Blockchain Developers\\n\\n#### 1. App Requirements\\n\\n1. Blockchain Developers are permitted to develop Blockchain Applications that integrate blockchain-based functionalities and the Service. Applications that constitute both a Blockchain Application and another type of Application (including but not limited to a Payments Application) are subject to the terms of this section as well as the terms that govern that other type of Application.\\n2. **Approval**. All Blockchain Applications are subject to Shopify's review and acceptance to ensure compliance with our guidelines, API documentation, and other standards that we deem necessary to protect the integrity of Shopify’s blockchain ecosystem. Shopify retains the right to remove a Blockchain Application from the Shopify App Store at any time for any reason. Blockchain Applications may only be distributed in the Shopify App Store.\\n3. **Blockchain Apps APIs**. Blockchain Developers must comply with the [Shopify API Terms](https://www.shopify.com/legal/api-terms). To help guide you through the development of your Blockchain Application, we maintain a list of requirements under [Blockchain Developer Guidelines](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/blockchain) that Blockchain Developers must follow. Every Blockchain Developer must adhere to these guidelines and every Blockchain Application must meet the technical and other specifications that it describes. Blockchain Developers may only use the Blockchain Apps APIs as specified in the [Blockchain Developer Guidelines](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/blockchain) and may not use any other Shopify APIs unless granted permission from Shopify. Blockchain Developer acknowledges that Shopify will update the Blockchain Apps APIs at its discretion. It is the Blockchain Developer’s responsibility to install any updated version of the APIs.\\n4. **Minimum Support Commitment**. Blockchain Applications must provide industry standard service levels to merchants. The Blockchain Application must at a minimum be operational and available on a twenty-four hour, seven days a week (24x7) basis at least 99.95% of the time in any measurement period. Blockchain Applications must provide servicing support to all Merchants and are required to provide Shopify with an email address which can be used by Merchants to contact the Blockchain Application directly for support.\\n\\n#### 2. Risk, Fraud \u0026 Compliance\\n\\n1. **Maintain a Risk \u0026 Fraud Program**. Blockchain Applications are responsible for monitoring and managing risk and fraud. If the Blockchain Application is being used by what Shopify deems as an unreasonably high percentage of Merchants who are engaging in fraudulent or high risk behavior, as determined in Shopify’s sole discretion, Blockchain Application agrees to collaborate with Shopify to implement and develop preventive measures to mitigate such risk. If Blockchain Application fails to collaborate with Shopify, or fails to take additional steps to reduce risk and fraud in a manner that we deem appropriate, we may take governance action against the Blockchain Application.\\n2. **Requests for and Sharing of Information**. You agree to share certain information about you and your Blockchain Application with Shopify. This includes you sharing information: (i) about blockchain transactions for regulatory or compliance purposes or as may be otherwise requested from time to time; (ii) that Shopify deems necessary, in our sole discretion, for the management and maintenance of Shopify’s ecosystem; (iii) that Shopify deems necessary, in our sole discretion, to conduct our risk management process.\\n3. **Compliance with Applicable Laws, Regulations \u0026 Standards**. Blockchain Developer must comply with any terms, guidelines or approval processes required pursuant to any applicable laws or regulations.\\n\\n#### 3. Unauthorized and Prohibited Activities\\n\\n1. **Fungible Tokens**. Blockchain Applications cannot mint, support, sell, transfer or modify any form of fungible tokens unless they have been approved as a Payments Developer and Payments Application.\\n2. **Secondary Sales and Royalties**. Blockchain Applications cannot support any secondary sales of non-fungible tokens, or the creation, minting or sale of any non-fungible tokens that contain secondary-level or transferable royalties.\\n3. **Securities and Other Financial Instruments**. Blockchain Applications cannot facilitate the minting, sale or marketing of non-fungible tokens that may be classified as securities or other forms of regulated financial instruments.\\n4. **Privacy and Data Usage**. Blockchain Applications cannot write or store any personal data on-chain, or directly within the blocks of blockchain. Blockchain Applications must not use Merchant data in any way that is not explicitly and accurately disclosed to the Merchant. Blockchain Developer must provide Shopify with any changes or updates to how they collect and use data in connection with their Blockchain Application. Blockchain Developer acknowledges that Shopify may share a summary of how data is collected and shared by the Blockchain Application in our communications with Merchants.\\n\\n#### 4. Termination, Suspension and Removal\\n\\nShopify may at its sole discretion remove your Blockchain Application from Shopify’s public list of payment gateways, suspend or terminate your access and your participation in Shopify’s blockchain ecosystem, or take any other action that we deem necessary for the violation of any clause in this Section “Additional Terms Applicable to Blockchain Developers.” For the avoidance of doubt, this Section does not preclude the termination rights set forth in Part A, Section 4 “Termination” of this Agreement.\\n\\n#### 5. Indemnification\\n\\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, the indemnification obligations outlined in this Section C.6.5 shall apply exclusively to Blockchain Developers and their activities as related to Blockchain Applications, thereby replacing Part A, Sections 8.2 and 8.3, of the Agreement in such instances. Where an App Developer’s Application classifies as both a Blockchain Application and another type of Application (including without limitation a Payments Application), the indemnification obligations in this Section C.6.5 shall control. For the avoidance of doubt, Part A, Sections 8.2 and 8.3, of the Agreement shall continue to govern and apply to non-Blockchain Developers and activities that are not specifically related to Blockchain Applications. This Section C.6.5 shall survive any termination or expiration of the Partner Agreement.\\n\\n1. **Partner Indemnification**. Partner agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and upon Shopify’s request, assume the defense of, Shopify and any Shopify Related Entities and the directors, officers, employees, subcontractors and agents thereof (each, an “**Indemnified Party**”, and collectively, the “**Indemnified Parties**”), with respect to any claim, demand, cause of action, debt, losses, or liability, whether or not foreseeable, including but not limited to any costs of investigation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and court costs (collectively, “**claims**”), arising from or relating to the following: (a) Partner’s breach of any representation, warranty, obligation or covenant under this Agreement; (b) Partner’s negligence or willful misconduct; (c) any warranty, condition, representation, indemnity or guarantee relating to Shopify and Shopify Related Entities granted by Partner to any Merchant, prospective Partner or other third party; (d) Partner’s use of the Shopify API (including without limitation the Sales Channel SDK and Shopify Billing API); (e) Partner’s breach of any term of this Agreement (including any documents it incorporates by reference) or a Merchant Agreement; (f) any violation of any law or regulation by Partner; (g) any third party claim that Partner’s products or services, including without limitation any Application, Theme, or Channel Platform, does not comply with any law or regulation or infringe the rights, including but not limited to intellectual property rights, of any person; (h) Partner Taxes, including any audits or penalties related thereto; (i) the performance, nonperformance or improper or defective performance of Partner’s products or services, including without limitation, any Application or Theme or Channel Platform; and (j) Partner’s relationship with any Merchant. The Indemnified Party’s recovery under this agreement shall not be subject to a duty to mitigate any losses suffered.\\n2. **Notice of Indemnification**. In claiming any indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will promptly provide Partner with written notice of any claim which the Indemnified Party believes falls within the scope of the indemnifications provided under this Agreement. Failure to give such prompt written notice shall not relieve Partner of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that Partner forfeits rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Partner may, at its own expense, assist in the defense if it so chooses, provided that, unless Partner has been asked to assume control of the defense under the section above, Indemnified Party will control such defense and all negotiations relative to the settlement of any such claim. For any claim in relation to which Indemnified Party has assumed control of the defense, Partner shall fully cooperate with Indemnified Party in connection therewith and shall reimburse Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs properly incurred in defending against the claim (including attorneys’ fees and expenses) and remain responsible to Indemnified Party for any claims indemnified under the section above. For any claim in relation to which Partner has assumed control of the defense, Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate with Partner in connection therewith and may employ, at any time, separate counsel to represent it; provided, that Partner is responsible for the costs and expenses of such separate counsel. Partner shall not enter into any settlement or agreement with any person that affects the Indemnified Party’s rights or binds the Indemnified Party in any way without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.\\n\\n## {{id=\\\"part-d\\\"}} Part D – Additional Terms Applicable to the Partner Directory and the Shopify Tiered Partner Program\\n\\nIn addition to the terms applicable to all Referral Partners, as set out in [Part B](https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms#part-b), the following terms apply to the Partner Directory and Partners accepted into the Tiered Partner Program.\\n\\n### 1. Partner Directory\\n\\n1. **Directory**. Tiered Partner Program members may be listed in the Partner Directory. Merchants may contact Partners listed in the Partner Directory.\\n2. **Communications**. Partner acknowledges and agrees that Shopify receives and can review all communications exchanged via the Partner Directory or in any reply emails that originate within the Partner Directory (directly or indirectly) between Partner and Merchant. As a participant in the Partner Directory, Partner consents to being contacted by Merchants at the email address provided by Partner to Shopify.\\n3. **Relationship**. The services provided by a Partner via the Partner Directory are the responsibility of the Partner and not of Shopify. It is the Partner’s responsibility to ensure that there is a Merchant Agreement in place between the Partner and Merchant for the services to be provided by the Partner to the Merchant, and that the Merchant Agreement includes appropriate remedies in the event of non-payment by Merchant for services rendered by the Partner, provided that any such remedy that includes the withholding of the transfer of ownership of the Development Store or Merchant Store to the Merchant will be enforced by Shopify at its sole discretion.\\n4. **Reviews**. Merchants are able to submit reviews and ratings on their experience with a Partner. A Partner’s rating is calculated based on reviews posted by Merchants. Partners may not solicit or permit reviews that are fake, inaccurate, irrelevant, misleading, being used improperly for commercial gain, posted in exchange for a financial or other gain, posted multiple times (whether from the same or more than one account), misleading as to the reviewer's identity or their connection to the Partner being reviewed, or reviews that contain or link to prohibited or illegal content. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful and trustworthy. Shopify reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary in respect of a Partner engaged in any of this behaviour, including the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit Merchant reviews.\\n\\n### 2. Tiered Partner Program\\n\\n1. **Designation**. From time to time Shopify may designate certain of its Partners as a **“Tiered Partner”**, to be listed on the [Shopify Partner Directory](https://www.shopify.com/partners/directory). The granting of a Tiered Partner designation is entirely within Shopify’s discretion.\\n2. **Revenue Sharing Plan**. The revenue sharing plans for the Partner Program are set out in Parts B and C of this Agreement, unless otherwise modified in a Partner addendum.\\n\\n### 3. Removal of Designation\\n\\n\u003caside\u003e\\n\\n### Which means\\n\\n**Shopify can designate Partner as a Tiered Partner in the Tiered Partner Program resources. These designations are at Shopify’s discretion, and can be removed at any time and for any reason. If Shopify removes the designation, the Partner must immediately stop referring to itself as a “Shopify Tiered Partner”.**\\n\\n\u003c/aside\u003e\\n\\nShopify may remove or revise the Tiered Partner designation at any time and for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, effective immediately upon notice to the relevant Tiered Partner. Upon notice of the revocation of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will remove Partner from the Tiered Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately cease referring to itself as a Tiered Partner on any Website or otherwise. Upon notice of a revision of such designation by Shopify, Shopify will update references to Partner’s tier within the Partner Program resources, and Partner will immediately update any references to its tier within the Partner Program on any Website or otherwise.\\n\\n## {{id=\\\"part-e\\\"}} Part E – Additional Terms Applicable to Ads in the Shopify App Store\\n\\nIn addition to the terms applicable to Developers elsewhere in this Agreement, the following terms apply to Ads.\\n\\n### 1. Fees\\n\\n1. **Auctions**. The price Developers pay for an Ad, and whether or not the Developer wins an auction for an Ad to be displayed, will be based upon (1) the daily budget set by the Developer in the Partner Dashboard, (2) the amount bid for various keywords and (3) a confidential relevance score created by Shopify to ensure that Merchants and other users see Ads that are relevant and valuable to them. Shopify will solely determine which Ads will be shown and nothing in this Agreement guarantees that Developer will win any auctions to display their Ads, have their Ads displayed or get any impressions or clicks. All bids entered by Developer are binding offers from Developer which may be accepted or rejected by Shopify in its sole discretion.\\n2. **Pricing**. The Developer will be charged for an Ad on a cost per click basis.\\n3. **Payments**. The Developer will provide a payment method to Shopify and hereby authorizes Shopify to automatically charge such payment method for Ads purchased in compliance with this Agreement. Developer may not set-off any of its payments for Ads against any other amounts due to Developer under this Agreement. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by Shopify, Developer’s payment method may be charged by Shopify (1) each time the Developer reaches $100 in Ad fees, including if necessary, multiple times per day, or (2) every thirty (30) days, whichever comes first.\\n\\n### 2. Ads\\n\\n1. **Content**. Most of the content of the Ads will be generated by Shopify and will not be customizable by the Developer. Ad names and all other content provided by Developer must comply with Shopify’s Acceptable Use Policy. You hereby grant Shopify a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid license to store, use, reproduce and display any Ad names or other content provided by Developer for purposes of delivering the Ads and managing the service herein. Except as expressly set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a transfer, license or assignment of any intellectual property rights.\\n2. **Keywords**. While the Developer may request certain triggering keywords for the Ads and negative triggering keywords as well, Shopify may prohibit and block the use of any keywords in its discretion. If broad keywords are selected by Developer, the actual triggering keywords implemented will be determined by Shopify in its sole discretion.\\n\\n### 3. Reporting\\n\\n1. **Reporting**. Shopify will provide the Developer with access to reporting through the Partner Dashboard. Shopify’s reporting is the sole and definitive measure of payment obligations for the Ads. All data in such reporting, and all usage and conversion data generated as a result of the Ads, is owned by Shopify. Developer may only use the reporting and metrics provided by Shopify to Developer for the performance and management of this Agreement and for its internal business purposes. Such reporting may not be shared by Developer with any third parties (other than on a confidential basis to its accountants and financial advisors).\\n2. **Disputes**. In the event that Developer disputes any reporting, Developer must notify Shopify in writing within seven (7) days of the date the report is first made available to Developer by Shopify, otherwise the Developer acknowledges the accuracy of such reporting and waives any claims based upon such reporting thereafter.\\n3. **Fraud**. The Developer agrees not to engage in, encourage, assist or authorize any third party to generate fraudulent traffic with respect to the Ads of any party, including but not limited to, through the use
