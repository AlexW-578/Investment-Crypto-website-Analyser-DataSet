We are committed to protecting your privacy and treating your personal information with transparency, care, and respect. This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect, use, and share (collectively, Access) your personal information, personal data, or the equivalent terminology in your region (collectively, Data). For reference, Data refers to any information that may directly or indirectly identify you. The Policy also explains how you can exercise your rights under applicable data protection and privacy laws, including data protection and privacy laws in California, Europe, and Brazil. Any reference in this Policy to Aidem, we, or our means Aidem Technologies LTD, and its direct and indirect global subsidiaries. 1. About Aidem Aidem is a global digital advertising marketplace. Our technology (the Aidem Platform) helps our clients deliver advertising to you. The Aidem Platform hosts digital auctions that help our clients buy and sell online ads (collectively, our Platform Services). These ads can be found on websites, mobile applications (apps), or video programming services, such as streaming apps on Smart TVs (collectively, Digital Properties). As with any exchange platform, we act as both as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, and as a buyer. Throughout this Policy, we refer to our clients that sell ad space as Publishers. Publishers own or operate the Digital Properties you may use or visit. We refer to clients that buy ad space (e.g., advertisers) as Buyers. Buyers may include Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) and other partners (collectively, Demand-Side Partners). Demand-Side Partners act as additional intermediaries in the digital advertising supply chain that connect advertisers to Aidem to serve relevant ads to you on the Publisher Digital Properties you visit. Demand-Side Partners liaise with other Buyers, which also include advertisers (e.g., brands), and advertising agencies (collectively, Ad Partners). In summary, Aidem and Demand-Side Partners act as intermediaries that connect Ad Partners with Publishers to deliver relevant digital ads to you. This Policy describes Aidem’s Data practices. It does not apply to information or Data collected by third parties, including those of Publishers or Buyers. We recommend that you consult the privacy policies of the Digital Properties you use in order to become familiar with their privacy practices.

We regularly review our security procedures to ensure the protection of your information. Please be aware, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately in accordance with the “Contact Us” Section below. Please note that all other sections of this Policy may also be applicable to the processing of your Data (for example, the Cookie and Website Notice below will also apply if you visit one of our websites). 12. Website and cookie notice This section explains Aidem __cf_bm cookie usage. Cloudflare’s bot products identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect our Website and Platform from bad bots. Cloudflare places the __cf_bm cookie on end-user devices that access our website and Platform protected by Bot Management or Bot Fight Mode. The __cf_bm cookie is necessary for these bot solutions to function properly. This cookie expires after 30 minutes of continuous inactivity by the end user. The cookie contains information related to the calculation of Cloudflare’s proprietary bot score and, when Anomaly Detection is enabled on Bot Management, a session identifier. The information in the cookie (other than time-related information) is encrypted and can only be decrypted by Cloudflare. A separate __cf_bm cookie is generated for each site that an end user visits, as neither Aidem nor Cloudflare track users from site to site or from session to session using this cookie. The __cf_bm cookie is generated independently by Cloudflare, and does not correspond to any user ID or other identifiers in Aidem’s Website or Platform. 13. Self-Regulation Initiatives Aidem supports efforts for self-regulation in the digital advertising industry. Aidem participates in the IAB’s Transparency &amp; Consent Framework and complies with its specifications and policies (Aidem’s identification number within the framework is 1218). 14. Changes to this policy We may change this Policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. The date at the top of this Policy reflects the most recent changes made. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post the revised Policy on our website and may take additional measures to inform you, as required by applicable data protection and privacy laws. 15.

</style><p>Welcome to Aidem Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and treating your personal information with transparency, care, and respect.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect, use, and share (collectively, Access) your personal information, personal data, or the equivalent terminology in your region (collectively, Data). For reference, Data refers to any information that may directly or indirectly identify you. The Policy also explains how you can exercise your rights under applicable data protection and privacy laws, including data protection and privacy laws in California, Europe, and Brazil.</p>
<p>Any reference in this Policy to Aidem, we, or our means Aidem Technologies LTD, and its direct and indirect global subsidiaries.</p>
<h2 class="scroll-mt-[var(--headings-scroll-mt)]" id="1-about-aidem">1. About Aidem</h2>
<p>Aidem is a global digital advertising marketplace. Our technology (the Aidem Platform) helps our clients deliver advertising to you. The Aidem Platform hosts digital auctions that help our clients buy and sell online ads (collectively, our Platform Services). These ads can be found on websites, mobile applications (apps), or video programming services, such as streaming apps on Smart TVs (collectively, Digital Properties).</p>
<p>As with any exchange platform, we act as both as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, and as a buyer. Throughout this Policy, we refer to our clients that sell ad space as Publishers. Publishers own or operate the Digital Properties you may use or visit. We refer to clients that buy ad space (e.g., advertisers) as Buyers. Buyers may include Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) and other partners (collectively, Demand-Side Partners). Demand-Side Partners act as additional intermediaries in the digital advertising supply chain that connect advertisers to Aidem to serve relevant ads to you on the Publisher Digital Properties you visit. Demand-Side Partners liaise with other Buyers, which also include advertisers (e.g., brands), and advertising agencies (collectively, Ad Partners). In summary, Aidem and Demand-Side Partners act as intermediaries that connect Ad Partners with Publishers to deliver relevant digital ads to you.</p>
<p>This Policy describes Aidem’s Data practices. It does not apply to information or Data collected by third parties, including those of Publishers or Buyers. We recommend that you consult the privacy policies of the Digital Properties you use in order to become familiar with their privacy practices.</p>
<p>Please note, Sections 1-10 of this Policy provide information about the Data we Access in the provision of our Platform Services to our clients. For information on our corporate Data collection practices, please refer to Section 11 <a href="https://kb.aidem.com/privacy/policies/privacy-policy/#11-corporate-policy">Corporate Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

to Aidem Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and treating your personal information with transparency, care, and respect.\n\nThis Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect, use, and share (collectively, Access) your personal information, personal data, or the equivalent terminology in your region (collectively, Data). For reference, Data refers to any information that may directly or indirectly identify you. The Policy also explains how you can exercise your rights under applicable data protection and privacy laws, including data protection and privacy laws in California, Europe, and Brazil.\n\nAny reference in this Policy to Aidem, we, or our means Aidem Technologies LTD, and its direct and indirect global subsidiaries.\n\n## 1. About Aidem\n\nAidem is a global digital advertising marketplace. Our technology (the Aidem Platform) helps our clients deliver advertising to you. The Aidem Platform hosts digital auctions that help our clients buy and sell online ads (collectively, our Platform Services). These ads can be found on websites, mobile applications (apps), or video programming services, such as streaming apps on Smart TVs (collectively, Digital Properties).\n\nAs with any exchange platform, we act as both as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, and as a buyer. Throughout this Policy, we refer to our clients that sell ad space as Publishers. Publishers own or operate the Digital Properties you may use or visit. We refer to clients that buy ad space (e.g., advertisers) as Buyers. Buyers may include Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) and other partners (collectively, Demand-Side Partners). Demand-Side Partners act as additional intermediaries in the digital advertising supply chain that connect advertisers to Aidem to serve relevant ads to you on the Publisher Digital Properties you visit. Demand-Side Partners liaise with other Buyers, which also include advertisers (e.g., brands), and advertising agencies (collectively, Ad Partners). In summary, Aidem and Demand-Side Partners act as intermediaries that connect Ad Partners with Publishers to deliver relevant digital ads to you.\n\nThis Policy describes Aidem’s Data practices.

For more information on this, please refer to our [Website and Cookie Notice](https://kb.aidem.com/privacy/policies/privacy-policy/#12-website-and-cookie-notice).\n\nMore information on these three categories can be found below.\n\n## **3. Types of data we access**\n\nBelow is a list of Data we may Access solely for the provision of our Platform Services to our clients. We may not receive all of the information listed below every time we provide the Platform Services; the information we receive is predominantly determined by each Publisher with which you interact.\n\n* **Online identifiers (IDs)** – these are digital identifiers that may indirectly identify you and include:\n\n  * **Pixels** – HTML code snippets loaded when you visit a website that allows us to collect Data.\n\n  * **Third-party online identifiers** – IDs that belong to third parties. Third-party IDs may be associated to broad aggregate audience segments and shared with Buyers to serve more relevant ads to you based on your interests (e.g., ads related to sports or fashion).\n\n* **Browser information** – information including, but not limited to, the type and version of your browser, browser settings (such as language and local time), user agent, and your IP address.\n\n* **Device Information** – as applicable, general information including, but not limited to: device type (e.g., laptop, mobile, TV), model, manufacturer, operating system, time zone, telephone carrier information, network information (e.g., WIFI), and mobile application information.\n\n* **Location information** – geolocation information such as city, country, zip code/postal code, and/or longitude/latitude.\n\n## **4. How we use your data**\n\nWe Access your Data to provide our Platform Services. Please find described below the business purpose(s) for which we process Data, and our legal basis for doing so:\n\nWe Access your Data (per [Section 3](https://kb.aidem.com/privacy/policies/privacy-policy/#3-types-of-data-we-access) above) for the following business purpose(s):\n\n* **Ad delivery** – to deliver ads to you on Publishers’ Digital Properties.\n\n* **Ad reporting** – to verify an ad was delivered to you with accuracy.\n\n* **Troubleshooting, optimizing, and product improvement** – to improve our Platform Services and ensure ads are delivered correctly to you.\n\n* **Ad vetting** – to prevent fraud, malware, and other unacceptable behaviour.\n\n* **Privacy Rights** – to view and enforce your opt-out choices, and honour your privacy choices/rights. For example, we may Access your Data if you make a request to delete your Data.\n\nInternational law, such as European data protection law, requires us to have a legal reason for Accessing your Data. Aidem Accesses your Data under one or more of the following legal bases:\n\n* **Consent** – Aidem may Access your Data if you provide Publishers with the consent for us to do so. This means, for example, if you visit a website that has a cookie banner and click “Accept All”, Aidem will receive a technical signal confirming that you are providing us with the consent to Access your Data.\n\n* **Legitimate Interest** – we may also Access your Data if we have a legitimate reason to do so. For example, we Access your Data to protect our Platform Services from unauthorized access. Aidem will not override your privacy and/or fundamental rights and freedoms to exercise our legitimate interests.\n\n## **5. How Your data is shared with our partners**\n\nWe may disclose, share, or sell (collectively, Share) your Data with the following partners for the purpose of delivering ads to you:\n\n* **Buyers** - As noted above, we connect Publishers with Buyers of ad space. Buyers include Demand-Side Partners (other intermediaries) and Ad Partners (advertisers and ad agencies). We Share your data with Buyers to source ads that may be relevant to your interest(s). Buyers may Share your information with their clients and partners for the provision of their services. Each Buyer processes and Shares Data in accordance with their own privacy policies.\n\n* **Quality Vendors** - We may send your Data to third-party vendors that help maintain the integrity of our Platform Services; for example, by preventing malicious software (e.g., viruses, trojans), or traffic from non-humans (i.e., bots), from loading on the websites you browse.\n\n* **Legal Reasons** - We may be required to disclose your Data to comply with our legal obligations, or in cases where we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law.\n\nHow we protect your Data: If we Share your Data with another company, it becomes subject to their privacy practices which may differ from the information found in this Policy. To help protect your Data, Aidem contractually requires Buyers to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and implement user-centric privacy practices.\n\n## **6. International data transfers**\n\nWhile Aidem is a global company, we will not transfer your Data internationally. We respect the security and confidentiality of your data and maintain data locality within European and US jurisdictions.\n\nIf for Legal Reasons, we are compelled to transfer data internationally, we will ensure the transfers of your Data are compliant with the laws of that region, including the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n## **7. California Residents**\n\nAs a California Resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):\n\n* You have the right to know and access:\n\n  * the categories of personal information and specific pieces of personal information we have collected,\n\n  * the categories of personal information we have disclosed for a business purpose to third parties in the preceding 12-months,\n\n  * the categories of sources from which we collect personal information,\n\n  * the business or commercial purpose for collecting, sharing, or selling your personal information, and\n\n  * the categories of third parties with whom we disclose, sell, or share personal information with;\n\n* You have the right to request deletion of personal information that we have collected, subject to certain exceptions;\n\n* You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal information;\n\n* You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information; and,\n\n* You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your privacy rights conferred by the CCPA\n\n## **8.

We implement technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, and modification. Such measures include but are not limited to: (a) encryption, (b) controls that limit the access of your data, both technically and at our physical data center locations, and also (c) by enabling information security practices such employee training on the safe handling of Data. We regularly review our security procedures to ensure the protection of your information. Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us in accordance with the [“Contact Us” Section](https://kb.aidem.com/privacy/policies/privacy-policy/#15-contact-us) below.\n\n## **10. Data Retention**\n\nWe retain your Data for the time needed to provide our Platform Services, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

Website and cookie notice**\n\nThis section explains Aidem `__cf_bm` cookie usage.\n\n[Cloudflare’s bot products](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/reference/cloudflare-cookies/#__cf_bm-cookie-for-cloudflare-bot-products) identify and mitigate automated traffic to protect our Website and Platform from bad bots. Cloudflare places the `__cf_bm` cookie on end-user devices that access our website and Platform protected by Bot Management or Bot Fight Mode. The `__cf_bm` cookie is necessary for these bot solutions to function properly.\n\nThis cookie expires after 30 minutes of continuous inactivity by the end user. The cookie contains information related to the calculation of Cloudflare’s proprietary bot score and, when Anomaly Detection is enabled on Bot Management, a session identifier. The information in the cookie (other than time-related information) is encrypted and can only be decrypted by Cloudflare.\n\nA separate `__cf_bm` cookie is generated for each site that an end user visits, as neither Aidem nor Cloudflare track users from site to site or from session to session using this cookie. The `__cf_bm` cookie is generated independently by Cloudflare, and does not correspond to any user ID or other identifiers in Aidem’s Website or Platform.\n\n## **13. Self-Regulation Initiatives**\n\nAidem supports efforts for self-regulation in the digital advertising industry. Aidem participates in the IAB’s Transparency \u0026 Consent Framework and complies with its specifications and policies (Aidem’s identification number within the framework is 1218).\n\n## **14. Changes to this policy**\n\nWe may change this Policy to accommodate new technologies, industry practices, regulatory requirements or for other purposes. The date at the top of this Policy reflects the most recent changes made. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will post the revised Policy on our website and may take additional measures to inform you, as required by applicable data protection and privacy laws.\n\n## **15.

Policy","pageDescription":"Updated on: February 28, 2025","pageUpdatedAt":"2025-03-20T17:03:52.282Z","pageContent":"Welcome to Aidem Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and treating your personal information with transparency, care, and respect. This Privacy Policy (Policy) explains how we collect, use, and share (collectively, Access) your personal information, personal data, or the equivalent terminology in your region (collectively, Data). For reference, Data refers to any information that may directly or indirectly identify you. The Policy also explains how you can exercise your rights under applicable data protection and privacy laws, including data protection and privacy laws in California, Europe, and Brazil. Any reference in this Policy to Aidem, we, or our means Aidem Technologies LTD, and its direct and indirect global subsidiaries. 1. About Aidem Aidem is a global digital advertising marketplace. Our technology (the Aidem Platform) helps our clients deliver advertising to you. The Aidem Platform hosts digital auctions that help our clients buy and sell online ads (collectively, our Platform Services). These ads can be found on websites, mobile applications (apps), or video programming services, such as streaming apps on Smart TVs (collectively, Digital Properties). As with any exchange platform, we act as both as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, and as a buyer. Throughout this Policy, we refer to our clients that sell ad space as Publishers. Publishers own or operate the Digital Properties you may use or visit. We refer to clients that buy ad space (e.g., advertisers) as Buyers. Buyers may include Demand-Side Platforms (DSP) and other partners (collectively, Demand-Side Partners). Demand-Side Partners act as additional intermediaries in the digital advertising supply chain that connect advertisers to Aidem to serve relevant ads to you on the Publisher Digital Properties you visit. Demand-Side Partners liaise with other Buyers, which also include advertisers (e.g., brands), and advertising agencies (collectively, Ad Partners). In summary, Aidem and Demand-Side Partners act as intermediaries that connect Ad Partners with Publishers to deliver relevant digital ads to you. This Policy describes Aidem’s Data practices. It does not apply to information or Data collected by third parties, including those of Publishers or Buyers. We recommend that you consult the privacy policies of the Digital Properties you use in order to become familiar with their privacy practices.
