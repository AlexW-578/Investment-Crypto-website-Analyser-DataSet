<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><em>Table 1: Response and remedy times</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>Incidents</strong></p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Hive Streaming shall provide a qualified response to each Service Requests by a subject matter specialist and remedy Incidents in the Services that prevent the Services from substantially conforming to their specifications. To meet the response and remedy times set out in Table 1, the Customer approves that Hive Streaming may perform tests for the purpose of producing on-site diagnostics, improvements and partial corrections of the Services and the Software, patches, or a workaround substantially providing the same functionality as would be obtained without the Error. Customer also commits to being responsive and to reasonably assist Hive Streaming by providing the information and materials necessary to trouble shoot and remedy the Incident. The remedy times in Table 1 shall apply from the time when all necessary information and materials have been provided to Hive Streaming.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>Notice of Incidents.</strong> The Customer shall notify Hive Streaming of a Services problem by submitting a Support Request at the <span><a href="https://hivestreaming.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2">Hive Customer Helpdesk</a></span> site via email to support@hivestreaming.com or by calling +1-877-919-7322 (US) or +44 808 196 4807 (UK). Service Requests shall contain sufficient information for Hive Streaming to be able to reproduce the problem or to be able to start a meaningful error analysis.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 9px;">&nbsp;</span><strong>Classification of Service Requests.</strong>&nbsp;The Customer shall classify the priority of Service Requests with severity levels 1, 2 and 3 depending on the severity of the Incident, according to the definitions below. Re-classification of a severity level may be done by mutual agreement by the parties, if the selected priority does not match the severity of the incident in accordance with the definitions below.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">The issuer of the Service Requests shall request the priority. The following three Severity Levels shall be used to classify the Service Requests response priority:</p>
<p><strong><em>•<span>&nbsp;</span></em>Severity 1<br></strong>The presence of a Severity 1 incident implies that the Services have been rendered entirely non-functional and/or perform substantially below reasonable levels. Unavailability of Hive backend services or failure of a backend system(s) will be the root cause in these instances.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Example: The video portion of a live event with hive streaming enabled cannot be viewed (non-functionality of Hive Optimization); video traffic exceeding constrained values when using throughput manager and/or portions of the UI cannot be rendered (non-functionality of Hive Analytics).</p>
<p><strong>•<span>&nbsp;</span>Severity 2<br></strong>The presence of a Severity 2 Incident seriously affects the functionality of the Services, but can be circumvented so that the Services can be used, or implies that a program or function in the Services cannot be used although other programs or functions remain unaffected, or implies that the Services as a whole function but certain function(s) are somewhat disabled, give incorrect results or do not conform to documentation or any agreed standards.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Example: Video streaming achieved lower than expected rates of network offload adversely affecting video consumers with lower quality variants, buffering, and overall impacts on all users accessing the network. The generation of analytical reports timing out and/or data from recent events taking longer than expected to be surfaced (real-time data should be surfaced within minutes of an event; other trends and analyses may be performed periodically (at least once per day) and surfaced after the next time analytics is scheduled).</p>
<p><strong>•<span>&nbsp;</span>Severity 3<br></strong>A Severity 3 Incident has no significant effect on the functionality of the Services.</p>
<p>Example: Discrepancies in the numbers presented in analytics; software and/or algorithmic errors that affect a subset of devices or locations peering.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>Correction of Incidents.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Hive Streaming shall use reasonable efforts to complete the Temporary Remedy and the Final Remedy as soon as possible, but never later than within the time period set out in Table 1. Hive Streaming shall keep Customer informed of the progress of the correction work as well as, at Customer’s request, provide Customer with written progress reports.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>Availability and Uptime</strong></p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Availability of the Service means the availability at Connection Points. For every customer instance of the Services, Hive Streaming will provide external monitoring of the following Connection Points:</p>
<ul>
<li style="vertical-align: baseline; margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 9px;"> </span>Hive Streaming Helper Services access points</li>

<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Availability is calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Availability (%) = (MCM – PD* – D) / (MCM – PD*) x 100</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><em>*Excluding downtime for which Hive Streaming is not responsible, in accordance with the Service Level Exclusions.</em></p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>“Downtime” (“D”)</strong>&nbsp;means the period of downtime within the agreed hours of service minus the time of Permitted Downtime. Downtime is calculated from the moment in time the failure in availability is reported by the Customer or measured by Hive Streaming (whichever is earlier) until the Service becomes available. When determining availability in accordance with the formula above, downtime shall not include downtime that is not the responsibility of Hive Streaming in accordance with the Service Level Exclusions.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>“Maximum Connectivity Minutes” (“MCM”)</strong>&nbsp;is the total accumulated minutes during a Service Period for Service Domains. Maximum Connectivity Minutes is measured from the time when Customer has initiated a Service instance to the time Customer has stopped or deleted the Service instance.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>“Permitted&nbsp; Downtime” (“PD”)</strong>&nbsp;means (i) planned service and maintenance about which the Customer has been informed at least one (1) week in advance and which is limited to weekend downtime only in excess of one (1) hour per month outside of weekends, unless otherwise agreed by Customer or (ii) other downtime at the request of the Customer.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;"><strong>Service Credits</strong></p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by sending an email to <strong><span style="color: #333333;">h</span></strong><strong>ive-service-credits@hivestreaming.com</strong>.

<li style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;">The impacted Service(s).</li>
</ol>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Your failure to provide the requested and other information as required above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit. The amount and method of calculation of Service Credits are described in the definition. Service Credits are calculated for each Service Interval. Service Credits granted in any Service Interval shall not, under any circumstance, exceed the Service Fees due by the Customer for the specific Service Interval during which the Incident occurred. Any Service Credit granted will be credited to the Customer the month following the Service Level Failure.</p>
<p style="vertical-align: baseline;">Unless otherwise provided in the Agreement, this SLA sets forth your sole and exclusive remedies, and Hive’s sole and exclusive obligations, for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide the Services.</p>
