                <h3>FEES, PAYMENT AND SUSPENSION OF SERVICES. <span>Customer will pay Quantum the fees for the Quantum Service and other related services (<b><i>"Fees"</i></b>) in accordance with the applicable Order Form.  All Fees will be billed in advance on an annual basis and are due within 30 days of receipt of invoice, unless otherwise provided in the applicable Order Form. In the event that Customer wishes to increase the number of Digital Properties and/or Sessions beyond the maximum number of Digital Properties and/or Sessions specified in the applicable Order Form, Customer shall be required to pay additional fees associated with the increased number of Digital Properties and Sessions, prorated for the remainder of the then-current term.  For avoidance of doubt, a Session is defined in Section 1.14 and Session volume is determined based on that definition.  Such overages will be calculated as set forth on the applicable Order Form. All Fees owed by Customer in connection with this Agreement are exclusive of, and Customer shall pay, all sales, use, excise and other taxes and applicable export and import fees, customs duties and similar charges that may be levied upon Customer in connection with this Agreement, except for employment taxes and taxes based on Quantum’s net income.  If Quantum reasonably determines that it is required to collect tax from Customer in connection with this Agreement or an Order Form issued hereunder, then Quantum may include the amount of such tax on the applicable invoice(s), and Customer shall pay such invoiced taxes in addition to the Fees. Customer shall pay to Quantum a late payment fee equal to 2% per month of any Fees or invoiced taxes not paid within 15 days of the payment due date until such amount is paid in full. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Quantum reserves the right (in addition to any other rights or remedies Quantum may have) to discontinue the Quantum Service and suspend the UserIDs and Customer’s access to the Quantum Service if any Fees set forth in the Order Form or due in accordance with this Section 5 are more than 15 days overdue until such amounts are paid in full. Customer shall maintain complete, accurate and up-to-date billing and contact information.</span></h3>

The Receiving Party shall be fully responsible for the breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Recipients. The Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public; (ii) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (iii) was rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party; (iv) was independently developed without use of any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (v) is required to be disclosed by law (but only to the extent such disclosure is required) after giving the Disclosing Party as much advance notice of the possibility of such disclosure as reasonably practicable so that the Disclosing Party may attempt to stop such disclosure or obtain a protective order concerning such disclosure (except that no notification is required if the Receiving Party is prohibited by law from notifying the Disclosing Party).  Confidential Information disclosed to the Receiving Party remains the property of the Disclosing Party.  All Confidential Information and any copies shall be promptly destroyed or returned to the Disclosing Party upon the termination of this Agreement or upon the Disclosing Party's earlier request, except to the extent the Receiving Party is obligated to retain by law, or that has been stored on routine back-up media solely for the purpose of disaster recovery will be subject to destruction in due course, provided that such Confidential Information cannot be accessed in the ordinary course of business prior to destruction. This Agreement states the entire, exclusive agreement between the parties concerning the disclosure of Confidential Information, including through use of the Quantum Service, and any confidentiality, non-disclosure, or similar agreement between the parties, shall be superseded, terminated, and of no further force and effect as of date Customer accepts these terms and/or uses the Quantum Service.</span></h3>
