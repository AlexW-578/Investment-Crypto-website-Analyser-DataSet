Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address). Our websites, apps and other services may use these technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and to store data on your computer or other device so the website or app can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service. Depending on your interactions with us, these technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Fox News Services, such as pages you have visited, search history, and the video and other content you have viewed.</p><p>Other parties that support the Fox News Services, for example, by serving advertisements, providing analytics, or other services, may also use these technologies to collect similar information when you use the Fox News Services or other parties’ services. Those other parties may also use these technologies, along with activity information they collect, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile device and a laptop or other computer. In some circumstances, their use is governed by the privacy policies of the parties using such technologies.
