<h4>13. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.</h4>
<h5>13.1 Arbitration.</h5>
<p>The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<h5>13.2 Costs of Arbitration</h5>
<p>The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Company will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Company will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
<h5>13.3 Small Claims Court &amp; Infringement</h5>
<p>Either you or Company may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>
<h5>13.4 Waiver of Jury Trial</h5>
<p>YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Company are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Company over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<h5>13.5 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions</h5>
<p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Company is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 13.7 below.</p>
<h5>13.6 Opt-out</h5>
<p>You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section 13 by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="mailto:legal@statsig.com">legal@statsig.com</a> within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration provision.</p>
<h5>13.7 Exclusive Venue</h5>
<p>If you send the opt-out notice in Section 13.6, and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Company to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Company agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.</p>
<h4>14. Uptime Commitment</h4>
<p>Statsig will use commercially reasonable efforts to make Statsig’s Console (User Interface) and APIs in a Customer production instance (the “Services”) available with all material features and services operating and available for use, in each calendar month with an uptime percentage of 99.95% for all <strong>Enterprise Customers with Premium Support</strong> (the “Uptime Percentage”). The Uptime Percentage is equal to: (Maximum Available Minutes – Downtime) / Maximum available minutes X 100.</p>
<p>If the Uptime Percentage for the month is less than 99.95%, a Service Credit, calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by Customer for the Services during the month in accordance with the schedule below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Monthly Uptime Percentage</th>
<th>Service Credit Percentage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Equal to or greater than 99.9% but less than 99.95%</td>
<td>5%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Equal to or greater than 98% but less than 99.9%</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Less than 98%</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5>14.1 Exclusions</h5>
<p>The calculation of uptime will not include unavailability caused by one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduled maintenance time: Statsig will notify Customer at least five (5) business days in advance of any scheduled routine maintenance. Scheduled Maintenance will not exceed four (4) hours each month in the aggregate and will only take place between the hours of 10pm and 4am Pacific Time;</li>
<li>Emergency maintenance time (non-scheduled): Statsig will promptly notify Customer (via email or through the Services) of any non-scheduled or emergency maintenance and any other anticipated outages or performance degradation;</li>
<li>Suspension or termination of the Services;</li>
<li>Failure of Customer or third-party equipment, software or technology upon which the Services are dependent, including, but not limited to, cloud infrastructure services upon which the Services operate, and inaccessibility to the Internet, provided that such failure or inaccessibility is not caused by Statsig’s infrastructure and is otherwise outside of Statsig’s control;</li>
<li>Force majeure event;</li>
<li>Attack on Statsig’s infrastructure, including without limitation, a denial of service attack or unauthorized access, provided that such attack did not occur as a result of Statsig’s failure to maintain industry standard organizational controls and technical measures;</li>
<li>Unavailability caused by Customer’s breach of this Agreement.</li>
</ul>
<h5>14.2 Service Credit Procedures</h5>
<p>If Statsig fails to meet the Uptime Percentage, to be eligible for service credits, Customer must deliver a reasonably detailed, written request to <a href="mailto:support@statsig.com">support@statsig.com</a> no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the day on which Uptime Percentage first drops below 99.95%. To be deemed valid, the request must include: (a) The words “SLA Credit Request” in the subject line of the email; (b) The dates and times of each period of unavailability of the Services, with such accuracy as can reasonably be determined; © A description of the events that may have indicated an unavailability during the stated dates and times; and (d) Monitoring logs or supporting evidence corroborating Customer’s claimed outage, with any confidential or personally identifying information removed.</p>
<p>Statsig will determine, in its reasonable discretion, Customer’s eligibility for Service Credits and the amount of service credits awarded pursuant to this SLA. If Statsig confirms that the Uptime Percentage has not been achieved during a given month, Statsig will issue a service credit during the billing cycle following the term in which it is determined that Customer is eligible. All Service Credits will be applied to fees due from Customer for the Services; Statsig will not pay any Service Credit as a refund. If Statsig denies the claim, Statsig will provide the information used to validate such determination available to Customer for 30 business days, for auditing by Customer.</p>
<p>LIMITATION: THE SERVICE CREDITS DESCRIBED IN THIS SLA ARE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR THE UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES.</p>
<h4>15. Miscellaneous.</h4>
<p>You shall comply with all applicable export laws, restrictions and regulations in connection with your use of the Services, and will not export or re-export the Services in violation thereof. This Agreement is personal to you and you shall not assign or transfer the Agreement or the Services to any third party under any circumstances; Company may assign or transfer this Agreement without consent. This Agreement represents the complete agreement concerning this license between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between them. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Also if you are one of the first ten people to email tore at statsig dot com saying you read this far, he will send you a tee shirt. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed under California without regard to any conflicts of law provisions thereof.</p>
