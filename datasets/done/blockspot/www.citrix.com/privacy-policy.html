A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon,” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.</p>
<p>We use these automated technologies to collect information about your device or equipment, browsing actions, and usage patterns. The information we obtain in this manner includes IP addresses and other identifiers associated with your devices including Apple Advertising Identifier or Android Advertising ID, types of devices connected to our Offerings, device characteristics (such as operating system), language preferences, referring/exit pages, navigation paths, access times, email open rates, browser preferences and characteristics, installed plugins, local time zones, local storage preferences, clickstream data, and other information about your online activities.</p>
<p>We use on our Online Channels both first-party cookies (served directly by our website domain when you visit our Online Channels) and third-party cookies (served by a third-party website when you visit our Online Channels and certain third-party websites with whom we have partnered). Some of these cookies are session cookies (which are automatically deleted when you close your browser) and others are persistent cookies (which remain on your computer or other Internet-connected device for a period of time after you end your browsing session, unless you delete them).</p>
<p>The cookies we use on our Online Channels include: strictly necessary cookies, functional cookies, analytics cookies, and targeting/advertising cookies, as described below.</p>
<h4 id="strickly-necessary-cookies"><b>Strictly Necessary Cookies</b></h4>
<p>We use strictly necessary cookies on our Online Channels that are necessary for us to provide you with our products and services. These include cookies used to securely authenticate you to our website and identify you after you have logged in and user-centric security cookies used to increase the security of the products and services we provide to you (such as to detect authentication abuses). Given the necessary functionality of these cookies, they typically do not require consent.</p>
<h4 id="functional-cookies"><b>Functional Cookies</b></h4>
<p>These cookies allow us to analyze your use of the Online Channels to evaluate and improve our performance. They may also be used to provide a better customer experience on the Online Channels. For example, remembering your log-in details, saving what is in your shopping cart, or providing us information about how our site is used.</p>
<h4 id="analytics-cookies"><b>Analytics Cookies</b></h4>
<p>We use analytics cookies to collect information on how users navigate and use our Online Channels, such as how the users traverse our Online Channels, the pages they view, how long they stay on a page and whether the page is displayed correctly or whether errors occur. Such cookies help us to improve the performance of our Online Channels and make the Online Channels more user-friendly. These cookies are provided by third-party analytics providers, including Google Analytics. To learn more about Google Analytics and how to opt out, please visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>.

<h4 id="ad-cookies"><b>Advertising Cookies</b></h4>
<p>Advertising cookies are used to control and manage online advertisements. These cookies may collect information on whether a user has reacted to an advertisement and visited another website. Such cookies help us offer you content and provide targeted information that is more relevant to your interests. They also help us to measure the effectiveness of our advertisements and communications. In the EU, we deploy analytics and advertising cookies on our websites only when users have opted-in as required by applicable law.</p>
<p>Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Online Channels. For mobile devices, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.</p>
<p>Additional information about our cookie practices and how to manage your cookie preferences is available in the Cookie Preferences link in the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using cookies or similar tools.</p>
<p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins on our Online Channels (such as Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook) also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Cloud Software Group is not responsible for these providers’ information practices.</p>
<h3 id="interest-based-ad"><b>Interest-Based Advertising</b></h3>
<p>When you use our Online Channels, both we and certain third parties (such as our advertising networks, digital advertising partners and social media platforms) collect information about your online activities, over time and across third-party websites (such as on websites that serve our ads). We may use such information to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party websites on which our ads are served. You may see certain ads on other websites because we engage third-party ad buying networks. Through such buying networks, we can target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based and contextual means.</p>
<p>The information our ad networks may collect on our behalf includes data about your visits to websites that serve Cloud Software Group advertisements, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in these ad networks. This process helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To learn how to opt out of this ad network interest-based advertising, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer at the bottom of the page for the Cloud Software Group business you are interested in managing cookie preferences for. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based advertising.</p>

<p>To the extent provided by the law of your jurisdiction, you may have privacy rights to access, correct, update, amend, delete, restrict the processing of your personal information, or object to automated decision-making based on your personal information.</p>
<p>When Cloud Software Group is acting as a “data controller” under applicable law, you may exercise such rights by completing a <a href="https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/4018c172-eddb-4188-b198-a30ab538e3d8" target="_blank">Privacy Request form</a> or by contacting us using the information under the <a href="#contact" aria-label="Navigate to the How To Contact Us section of this page">How To Contact Us</a> section of this Privacy Statement, or, where applicable, by accessing your Cloud Software Group account.

Depending on your location, you may have the right to file a complaint with a government regulator if you are not satisfied with our response.</p>
<p>When Cloud Software group is acting as a “data processor” and you wish to exercise your privacy rights of access and request corrections, suppression, or deletion, we will direct you to the data controller under the applicable data protection laws. Alternatively, to exercise any rights relating to personal information processed on behalf of our customers in connection with the use of our products and services, end users may directly contact the relevant customer, not Cloud Software Group.
