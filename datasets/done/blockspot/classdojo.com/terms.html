<p>Weâve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms. Weâve also added summaries below each section that provide short explanations of the legal language in plain English. These short summaries, which start with âBasically...â, are to aid in understanding only and are not intended to be legally binding.</p></div></details><details id="the-classdojo-terms" class="css-1f1vurp e15a1zu69"><summary><span class="nessie-text e15a1zu61 css-9zsane">The ClassDojo Terms</span></summary><div><p>These Terms of Service contain general terms that apply to you as a user of the ClassDojo Service (&quot;User&quot;), along with additional terms that may apply to you as a User registered as a teacher, school leader, school administrator, aide, or other similar personnel (&quot;School Personnel&quot;), a Parent User (as defined below), or a Student (as defined below). If you are School Personnel, you will also be subject to ourÂ <a href="https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf">Student Data Protection Addendum (âStudent DPAâ)</a> that further governs the use of <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a>. Additionally, if a school district is directly contracting with ClassDojo (âSchool Districtâ), as opposed to individual School Personnel on behalf of a school, the School District and ClassDojo will also enter into the specific school district terms of service (the â<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16a9F4E7kbF6BWPIUXOeUz-XgGbFagbkloSlMW2jpGWY/edit?usp=sharing">District Terms</a>â).</p>
<p>If you are purchasing any premium features (such as <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732">ClassDojo Plus (âPremium Featuresâ)</a>) through the ClassDojo Service you will be also subject to the <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/">ClassDojo Premium Features Terms</a>. If you are using or purchasing any ClassDojo fictional currency (âClassDojo Virtual Currency â) or redeeming your ClassDojo Virtual Currency in any ClassDojo store or shop made available by ClassDojo on the ClassDojo Services (âClassDojo Shopâ) for virtual goods or virtual services (âVirtual Goodsâ), you will also be subject to the ClassDojo <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/virtual-tos">Virtual World Terms</a>. Additionally, if you partake in any sweepstakes, giveaways, or promotions (âSweepstakesâ) we may offer you, you will be subject to the Sweepstakes Terms that are linked from that specific Sweepstakes.</p>
<p>The Student DPA, District Terms, Premium Features Terms, Virtual World Terms, and Sweepstakes Terms (collectively &quot;Terms&quot;) are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p>When using the Service, you will also be subject to any posted guidelines, policies, or rules applicable to specific features of the Service, which may be posted from time to time (collectively the âGuidelinesâ). These Terms of Service and Terms, including any other Guidelines and future modifications (collectively, the âAgreementâ), govern your use of the Service and is a legal contract between you and ClassDojo. If there is any inconsistency between the Terms of Service, Terms, and any of the Guidelines, the additional Guidelines will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<p>ClassDojo cares about your privacy. The <a href="http://www.classdojo.com/privacy">ClassDojo Privacy Policy</a> describes our data practices, including the types of information we receive and collect from you, how we use and share this information, and your rights in relation to the processing of information about you.</p></div></details><details id="agreeing-to-our-terms" class="css-1f1vurp e15a1zu69"><summary><span class="nessie-text e15a1zu61 css-9zsane">Agreeing to our Terms</span></summary><div><p>By registering for an account on, or otherwise accessing or using the ClassDojo Service, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you are using the Service on behalf of a school, School District, or other similar educational institution (âEducational Institutionâ) that has a separate written agreement with ClassDojo (outside of the Student DPA), that agreement will govern our use of <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a>, but this Agreement shall still apply to your use of the Service, unless otherwise indicated in writing.</p>
<p>Users under the age of 18 (âMinor Usersâ) require a parent or legal guardian (or School Personnel if used in connection with an Educational Institution) to allow them to use the Services and to agree to the Agreement. By permitting a Minor User to use the Services, the parent, legal guardian, or School Personnel becomes subject to this Agreement and agrees to be responsible for the Minor User&#x27;s activities on the Services. If you are a Minor User, you represent that your parent, legal guardian or School Personnel has reviewed and agreed to the Agreement. If you donât get your parent, guardian or School Personnel to read and agree to the Agreement, you donât have permission to use the Service. Additionally, for Minor Users under the age of 13, ClassDojo follows the United States Federal Trade Commissionâs (âFTCâ) <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions">Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Act</a> and its implementing regulations under the Childrenâs Online Privacy Protection Rule (collectively âCOPPA) consent rules that prohibit online service providers from knowingly collecting <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703">personal information</a> from children under 13 years of age without verifiable parental consent or notice as applicable (âConsentâ). ClassDojo extends the U.S.-based COPPA consent protections in all jurisdictions, even if not required. If we rely on other legally applicable grounds for processing childrenâs personal information (e.g., if we rely on legitimate interest in the European Union and the United Kingdom), we will still use the FTC COPPA consent methods described to provide further transparency for parents.</p>
<p><a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a> may be obtained either from 1) ClassDojo if the parent is setting up a Student Account (as defined below) or Outside School Child Account (as defined below) directly or is allowing their child to use certain Premium Features within their parent account or otherwise access the Service, or the student has received a unique link from their teacher to set up their own Student Account; or 2) a studentâs teacher, school, or School district if the teacher, school or School District is setting up the Studentâs Account and allowing the Student to log in (such as through the use of a <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018581572">QR code</a>, class text code, or <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018868571">Google Login</a>) or otherwise allowing Students to access ClassDojo from school (â<a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a>â).</p>
<p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity (including if you are School Personnel entering on behalf of your Educational Institution), you represent that you have the authority to bind said entity to these terms and conditions, in which case the terms âyouâ, âyourâ or âUserâ shall refer to such entity. <strong>If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not accept this Agreement and may not use the Service</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Basically,</strong><br/>
<strong>By using or signing up for ClassDojo, you agree to these terms. If you are under the age of 18, your legal guardian or parent will need to review and agree to the Agreement on your behalf. Welcome to the community!</strong></p></div></details><details id="registration-and-security" class="css-1f1vurp e15a1zu69"><summary><span class="nessie-text e15a1zu61 css-9zsane">Registration and Security</span></summary><div><p>As a condition to using Service, you may be required to register with ClassDojo and select a secure password and username or provide additional contact information (&quot;ClassDojo User ID&quot;). Alternatively, (1) an Educational Institution or School Personnel or (2) a parent may create accounts and logins for Students or their child (âStudent Login(s)â) and a parent may also create accounts for their child for use outside of school (not in connection with school use)(âOutside School Child Loginâ). When you create a ClassDojo User ID, Student Login or Outside School Child Login, you must provide the Company with accurate, complete, and updated Student Login and Outside School Child Login information. You may not select or use a Student Login, Outside School Child Login, or the name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. You will not provide any false information or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission. ClassDojo reserves the right to refuse registration or to cancel a Student Login or Outside School Child Login at its discretion.</p>
<p>You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials, Student Login, Outside School Child Login, password, or QR code (âAccount Credentialsâ) and will not share with anyone or let anyone else access your Account Credentials or account. You may not transfer your Account Credentials or account to anyone without express prior written consent of ClassDojo. ClassDojo will not be liable for any direct or indirect loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your Account Credentials, either with or without your knowledge or for a failure to comply with this Section. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by ClassDojo or another party due to someone else using your Account Credentials.</p>
<p>You expressly agree to (a) immediately notify ClassDojo of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security of your Account Credentials, account or a child&#x27;s personal information, and (b) ensure that you properly log out from your account at the end of each session on a shared device.</p>
<p>You represent, warrant, and covenant that (1) all Account Credential information you submit is truthful and accurate, and (2) if you are setting up a Student Login or Outside School Child Login, that you have obtained any and all necessary rights, permissions, or consents to access, set up, monitor, use or disclose any data from such accounts of other Users.</p>
<p><strong>Basically,</strong><br/>

<h4>Activities and Student Data Free Output</h4>
<p>By default, if School Personnel contribute Activities or User Modified Output that does not contain any Education Records or Student Data (âStudent Data Free Outputâ) , such Activities or Student Data Free Output will be licensed royalty-free to ClassDojo under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (âCC Licenseâ), which is available at <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a>. Such Activities or Student Data Free Output shall be available to the School Personnel&#x27;s Educational Institution and its Users. In addition, ClassDojo may also sub-license such Activities to other Users of the Services at other Educational Institutions. By accepting the Terms, You acknowledge and agree that Activities will be licensed under the CC License unless you &quot;opt-out&quot; of sharing to other Educational Institutions. Such Activities will continue to be licensed under the CC License until School Personnel âturns offâ such sharing for that particular Activities. However, you understand and agree that if you &quot;turn-off&quot; sharing for Activities (i) the Activities will be available to Users within the School Personnel&#x27;s school only; (ii) the change is prospective and does not terminate any sub-licenses to the underlying Activities previously granted by ClassDojo to any third parties (such as teachers from other schools and districts), and (iii) ClassDojo thereafter shall not grant any additional sub-licenses for the underlying Activities to third parties such as other schools.</p>
<h4>License Termination</h4>
<p>The license in the License Section above will terminate when you or your Educational Institution delete (i) any User Content with intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) (âIP contentâ)), (ii) personally identifiable information (such as that in <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a> or an Education Record), or (iii) your account. Such termination may not apply if your User Content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. When you post User Content in <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621">Class Islands</a>, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103-What-is-Class-Story-and-School-Story-">Stories</a>, or <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732">Portfolios</a> this can be viewed by other teachers, students and parents and it means that you are allowing others to access and use that information and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture if you provide one as a teacher, student, or parent).</p>
<p>Note, however, that any User Content that may be in an Education Record or <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a> (including User Content in or related to messages sent through <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309">ClassDojo Messaging</a>, Stories or Portfolios, may be kept after you delete your account for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of âeducation recordsâ under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or Student Data under various state student privacy laws or similar laws in international jurisdictions).

<p>You acknowledge that ClassDojo and its designees (such as teachers) reserve the right, but shall have no obligation (except as may be required by applicable law), to pre-screen, filter, edit, approve, remove, refuse to accept, post, display, or transmit any User Content through or on the Service in whole or in part at any time for any reason or no reason with or without notice and without liability of any kind. Additionally, we do not guarantee that we will publish any of your User Content and reserve the right to block or suspend the availability of any User Content, or to remove User Content from the Service at any time for any reason, and without obligation to any User, such as if we receive a notice reports a User Content infringes someoneâs intellectual property rights or otherwise violates this Agreement.</p>
<h4>Your Likeness</h4>
<p>ClassDojo does not permit User Content containing personal information of Users under the age of 13 to be available to the general public.</p>
<p>If you as a parent, child or School Personnel, upload any User Content to any area of our Service in areas that may be viewed by others (for example, in <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103-What-is-Class-Story-and-School-Story-">Stories</a> or <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621">Dojo Islands</a>) containing your likeness or the likeness of others, you (or your parent) also agree to the following:</p>
<p>You (or your parent) consent to the use of your likeness, and you have obtained (as necessary) the written consent, release, and/or permission of every identifiable individual who appears in your User Content to use such individual&#x27;s likeness, for purposes of using and otherwise exploiting the User Content in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, or, if any such identifiable individual is under the age of eighteen (18), you have obtained any necessary written consent, release and/or permission from such individual&#x27;s parent or guardian (and you agree to provide to us a copy of any such consents, releases and/or permissions upon our request).

<h3>School Personnel</h3>
<p>If you are a School Personnel accessing the Service on behalf of an Educational Institution, the following terms apply to you:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Permissions and Authority:</strong> You agree that you are acting on behalf of (or have received all necessary permission from) your Educational Institution to enter into this Agreement and to register and use the Service as part of your curriculum. Only School Personnel who are current employees of the Educational Institution may use the Service on the Educational Institution&#x27;s behalf.

Upon termination of a School Personnel or other staff member&#x27;s employment with the Educational Institution, such individual must return and cease using all login details and Student access he or she has in his or her possession. If at any time you learn a User of the Service claims to be affiliated with your Educational Institution who is not, in fact, affiliated with your Educational Institution, you will notify ClassDojo immediately at privacy@classdojo.com.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Students under 13:</strong> You further understand and acknowledge that COPPA prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703">personal information</a> from children under 13 years of age without Consent and you understand that we will not let children under the age of 13 use certain features of the Service unless:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ClassDojo obtains <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a> from the childâs parent or legal guardian if 1) the parent is creating a Student Account for the Student on ClassDojo or allowing the Student to access and use the Services on the parent device; or 2) the Student has created their own Student Account using the unique student code given to them by their teacher; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You provide <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a> in situations where you set up the childâs Student account on their behalf to enable them to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web">log in</a> or otherwise access certain features of the Service in the classroom (or at home for school purposes) which may result in the collection of personal information from the child. ClassDojo will not provide use of Student Accounts or access to the Service to children under the age of 13 if we are unable to obtain Consent or learn that you have not provided School Consent. You agree that you will not knowingly create a childâs Student Account on their behalf or allow the child to use the Service in the classroom until you have provided <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that for users based outside of the United States, we do not rely on consent as our legal basis for processing personal data under applicable privacy laws. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.classdojo.com/privacy">ClassDojo Privacy Policy</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(iii) <strong>School Consent</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that ClassDojo has provided to you (a) the direct notice required under 16 C.F.R. Part 312.4 of COPPA as set forth <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/article_attachments/27178771600909">here</a> (âDirect Noticeâ) and (b) a link to ClassDojoâs notice of privacy practices that includes a description of all personal information that is collected and how it will be used and disclosed as set forth <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986-For-teachers-Getting-consent-from-parents">here</a>. Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that you have read the Direct Notice and privacy practices. You, on behalf of the Educational Institution, (i) authorize ClassDojo to collect and use the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> of Students in the Service for <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447">educational purposes; and (ii) acknowledge and agree that you have the authority to authorize the collection described in (i) and to act as the agent of the parent.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447">Additionally,</a> you acknowledge and agree that when this <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a> described above is utilized to allow children under 13 to use the Service, you will be responsible (and hereby agree that ClassDojo is not responsible) for 1) providing all required notices and disclosures to parents under COPPA in a format you deem appropriate, including the Direct Notice (of which ClassDojo will provide relevant information to you and/or the Educational Institutions or other School Personnel); 2) <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions#N.%20COPPA%20AND%20SCHOOLS">acting as the agent of the parent</a> and consenting on their behalf) under COPPA; and 3) providing a means for a parent to review any <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703">personal information</a> contained in Student Data or Education Records collected through the Service and refuse to permit its further use as required by COPPA. For clarity, it is ClassDojoâs obligation to comply with COPPA as a whole. To do this, we rely on Educational Institutions to provide consent under COPPA by acting as the agent of the parent, but only after providing the Educational Institution with the required information and notices as set forth <a href="http://b">here</a>.</p>
<p>This includes without limitation, limiting access to the Service only to those Student Users from whom School Personnel has Consented for and complying with all parental requests regarding the collection, use and disclosure of such parentâs childâs personal information. If a Parent User rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Educational Institution shall immediately notify ClassDojo to discontinue that Studentâs access to the Service and ensure that such Studentâs information is no longer accessible through the Services. For more information on School Consent please see our <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">FAQ</a>. Under no circumstances will ClassDojo be liable for the School Personnelâs failure to consult their school&#x27;s authorities and administrators or for failing to provide School Consent when required.</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Parent Code</strong>. Each Student the teacher inputs on ClassDojo is assigned a <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289">unique parent code</a> by ClassDojo. This unique parent code is used by parents to connect with their childâs updates from school on ClassDojo. Parents may register for an account on ClassDojo without the unique parent code, including to utilize the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732">Premium Features</a> or to create an <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413231512205-What-are-Student-Accounts-and-Outside-School-Child-Accounts-#:~:text=%E2%80%9COutside%20School%20Child%20User%E2%80%9D%20means,features%20such%20as%20ClassDojo%20Plus.">Outside School Child Account</a>, but will be unable to connect with their childâs school to see their childâs or the schoolâs updates without a code or explicitly getting approved by a verified teacher to connect with a specific child (see <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050943651-Request-to-Connect-to-Your-Child-s-Teacher#web">here</a>). Parents with a ClassDojo account may give Consent for their child to have a Student Account or Outside School Child Account on ClassDojo. It is your responsibility to ensure that each student only shares his/her unique parent code with his/her parents. It is solely the School Personnelâs decision on how to communicate the parent code to the parent, including by sending home a private letter to the student&#x27;s parent or otherwise contacting the parent directly. Alternatively, if the School Personnel has access to the student&#x27;s parent contact information and has permission to do so, the School Personnel may provide ClassDojo with a list of parent email addresses or phone numbers for ClassDojo to send the parent code at the direction of and on behalf of the School Personnel (via email or SMS) to enable the parent to then create a parent account. For security reasons, Parent Codes expire and new ones can be generated by a teacher.</p>
<p>(v) <strong>Verifying Parents.</strong> School Personnel that are teachers may be asked to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046903851-How-to-Connect-Parents-with-a-Class-Link#web">verify</a> Parent Users as they sign-up for ClassDojo and ask to be connected to your class. You acknowledge and agree that ClassDojo may use this verification provided by <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043-What-Are-School-Approved-Teachers">verified</a> School Personnel to assist with verifying the identity of the Parent User for <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-">Consent</a> purposes.</p>

If you use any Parent Communications tools, you must only use them for educational subject matter and must abide by our <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/216456823">Parent Communication Guidelines</a>.</strong></p>
<h3>Parents and Guardians</h3>
<p>If you are at least 18 years of age and you are the legal parent or guardian of a Student or Outside School Child User (âParent Userâ) you can create a Parent User account on the Service (âParent Accountâ). Additionally, as a Parent User, you can link your Parent Account to your childâs Student Account through the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202047699-Connecting-to-Your-Child-s-Class-via-a-Parent-Code#web">unique parent code</a> provided by your childâs Educational Institution. With a Parent Account, you may then (i) create either a Student Account or Outside School Child Account for your child on the Service, (ii) allow your child to create their own account (âStudent Created Accountedâ), (iii) allow your child to access or use the Service, including on your device, without setting up a separate Outside School Child Account or Student Account. The following terms apply to you as a Parent User:</p>
<p>(i) <strong>Creating Your Childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account:</strong> If you would like to create your childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account at home, you must first have created a Parent Account on ClassDojo. IF YOU REGISTER OR CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR, APPROVE OR <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603-What-consent-does-ClassDojo-require-from-parents">CONSENT</a> TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USERâS LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE SERVICES BY THE CHILD USER.</p>
<p>To create your childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account, we will first require your <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a>. In order to comply with COPPA and similar laws in other applicable jurisdictions, which govern the online collection of data from children, ClassDojo may take additional steps to verify that the user granting permission for the creation of a childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account is his or her parent or legal guardian. You acknowledge that ClassDojo may choose to make inquiries, either directly or through third parties, that ClassDojo deems necessary to validate your registration information, including, without limitation, engaging third parties to provide verification services. The current ways in which we seek to verify are set forth in our <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046-For-parents-What-consent-must-parents-give-for-their-child-to-use-ClassDojo-">FAQ</a>. ClassDojo reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CLASSDOJO CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND CLASSDOJO IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USERâS CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USERâS ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.</p>
<p>Any Student Account created by you, your childâs teacher, or your child directly are linked together (these are not different accounts, but rather the same singular account). Additionally, any Outside School Child Account will also be linked with the Student Account (if both exist), but only certain content will be viewable by the childâs teacher. Please see ourÂ <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412479507085"><strong>FAQ</strong></a>Â for more details, including on what information will be shared between the two accounts (with your Consent).</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Your Consent:</strong> If your child is under the age of 13, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a> must be given in order for 1) you to create the Student Account or Outside School Child Account; 2) your child to create a Student Created Account; or 3) your childâs School Personnel to create a Student Account on behalf of your child, enabling them to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web">log in</a>. In the UK and the European Union, we may rely on other lawful bases to process your childâs data, but nonetheless seek parental consent under COPPA to provide additional transparency for parents.</p>
<p>This Consent may be obtained either by: 1) ClassDojo if (a) you are setting up your childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account or (b) your child is setting up the Student Created Account (if not created in connection with the unique code received from their teacher) or you are allowing your child to access or use the Service without setting up an account, including on your device or account; or 2) a Studentâs School Personnel (through <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a>) if they are setting up your childâs Student Account, enabling them to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210542566-How-Do-I-Log-Into-My-Student-Account-#web">log in</a>, or otherwise allowing them to access and use the Service in school.</p>
<p>In addition to providing Consent when creating your childâs Outside School Child Account or Student Account, there may be instances where we will also ask you to provide additional Consent as set forth <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046">here. For example,</a> a heightened level of verifying you are the parent in order to provide Consent may be required when some of the features that your child may use in <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019674032-ClassDojo-Plus-FAQs-for-Teachers-Premium-Feature">Premium Features</a> or Home Islands require a heightened level of parental verification under COPPA. This may mean that we canât rely on the lower level of âverificationâ that you are the childâs parent when we initially obtained your Consent if it was obtained through the âemail plusâ method at the time you created your childâs account.</p>
<p>If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who is using the Service and your childâs Student Account was not set up by your childâs School Personnel, or you did not give Consent while setting up your childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account, you can email us at privacy@classdojo.com to have that childâs Student Account or Outside School Child Account deleted. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to School Personnel when the school is obtaining School Consent, we may send an email asking you to verify your childâs account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.</p>
<p>In addition to the Consent provided under COPPA, we also will seek to obtain your consent to the sharing and use of certain <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms">Student Data</a> or <a href="https://help.classdojo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms">educational records</a> from your childâs Student account to their Outside School Child Account as set forth in our <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/child-privacy#how-use-children-information">Childrenâs Privacy Policy</a> and as set forth below in the section â<em>Consent to Sharing Student Data for Dojo Islandsâ</em>.</p>
<p>(iii) <strong>Responsible for Your Childâs User Content:</strong> Once your child has a Student Account or Outside School Child Account, they will be able to upload User Content, including Student Activity Responses, to the Student Account and <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211828723">Portfolios</a> (which is not viewable by the general public, but by linked parents, legal guardians and School Personnel) as well as in their Outside School Child Account, including in <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6519540372621">Dojo Islands</a>. You are solely responsible for reviewing and ensuring that such User Content submissions (when not submitted during or in connection with school use) meet all applicable conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, those in â<a href="https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#your-information-and-content">Your Information and Content</a>â and the â<a href="https://www.classdojo.com/terms/#acceptable-use-and-conduct">Acceptable Use and Conduct</a>â Sections and are solely responsible for any <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703">personal information</a> contained therein (if not removed by you). You can request to remove any User Content uploaded by your child either by 1) contacting your childâs School Personnel if the User Content was uploaded during school, and we will respond to valid requests received from the School Personnel or Institution, or 2) contacting us directly at privacy@classdojo.com when the User Content is collected directly from your child through their Outside School Child Account.</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Premium Features:</strong> If you are accessing or using the Premium Features, or allowing your child to access and use them, you will also be subject to the <a href="https://www.classdojo.com/premium-features-terms/">Premium Features Terms</a>. Additionally, if you are allowing your child to access and use Premium Features on your device or account, we will first require your <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a>. We may also seek your <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741603">Consent</a> for the use of certain Premium Features if <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">School Consent</a> was previously used. Additionally, if you or your child is utilizing a feature where <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703-Privacy-Policy-and-Terms-of-Service-Key-Terms#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a> or education records under <a href="https://static.classdojo.com/docs/TeacherResources/FERPAPrimer/FERPAPrimer.pdf">FERPA</a> will be used and shared between in school and out of school use (use not in connection with a school), you are consenting to this use and sharing.

For the purposes of FERPA, to the extent personal information from Education Records are transmitted to ClassDojo from an Educational Institution or from Students using accounts at the direction of the Educational Institution, ClassDojo shall be considered a School Official with a legitimate educational interest, and performing services otherwise provided by the Educational Institution.</p>
<p>If the Educational Institution has a policy of disclosing Education Records under FERPA, the Educational Institution shall include a specification of criteria for determining who constitutes a School Official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest in its annual notification of FERPA rights (âAnnual Notification of Rightsâ). Additionally, the Educational Institution represents, warrants and covenants to ClassDojo, as applicable, that the Educational Institution has:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complied with the School Official Exemption, including, without limitation, informing parents in their Annual Notification of Rights that the Educational Institution defines âSchool Officialâ to include service providers such as ClassDojo and defines âlegitimate educational interestâ to include services such as the type provided by ClassDojo; and/or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complied with the Directory Information Exemption (if relying on such exemption), including, without limitation, informing parents and eligible students what information the Educational Institution deems to be Directory Information and may be disclosed and allowing parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that schools not disclose Directory Information about them; and/or</p>

<p>If the Educational Institution is relying on the Directory Information exemption, the Educational Institution represents, warrants, and covenants to ClassDojo that it shall not provide information to ClassDojo from any student or parent/legal guardian that has opted out of the disclosure of Directory Information. ClassDojo depends on the Educational Institution to ensure that the Institution is complying with the FERPA provisions regarding the disclosure of any Education Records or Student Data that will be shared with ClassDojo. ClassDojo is not in a position to provide legal advice regarding whether the Educational Instution&#x27;s existing FERPA disclosures are sufficient. To the extent that School Personnel or the Educational Institutions have questions regarding these issues, they should consult the Educational Institution&#x27;s own legal counsel for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Basically,</strong><br/>
<strong>FERPA gives parents and Students certain rights over their <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004773623">education records</a>.

Additionally, non-Student Users (e.g., Parent User or other Family User) are permitted to associate their Family Outside School Accounts with their school accounts (â<strong>School Accounts</strong>â). Similarly, a User may choose to associate their Student Account with their Outside School Child Account in the same manner. If a User chooses to associate an Outside School Account with either their Student Account or School Account (as applicable), the two accounts will be deemed &quot;Linked Accountsâ. The Linked Accounts will use the same login to access both accounts, but the product data for in-school and out of school use is stored separately and only certain content will be viewable by School Personnel. Note however, that the login data (the username and password) is stored in one place and shared between both the Outside School Child Account and the Student Account.

<li>Generally: In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Company in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Company agree that, except as provided in subsection (b) below, any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Except as provided in subsection (b) below, our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to, all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</li>
<li>Exceptions: Notwithstanding subsection (a), we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</li>
<li>Opt-Out: If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section 25 within 30 days after the date that you first agreed to the companyâs Terms of Service by sending a letter to Class Dojo, Inc., Attention: Legal Department â Arbitration Opt-Out, 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America that specifies: your full legal name, the email address associated with your account on the Service, and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration (â<strong>Opt-Out Notice</strong>â). Once the Company receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 23 will be void and any action arising out of this Terms of Service will be resolved as set forth in Section 27. The remaining provisions of this Terms of Service will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice.</li>
<li>Arbitration: Any arbitration between you and Company will be governed by the American Arbitration Association (âAAAâ) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Procedures (&quot;AAA Rules&quot;), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Company.</li>
<li>Notice; Process: A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (&quot;Notice&quot;). Company&#x27;s address for Notice is: Class Twist, Inc., 735 Tehama St, San Francisco, CA 94103, United States of America. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;), and (c) identify the name or account of the party making the claim. We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but If we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Company shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.</li>
<li>Arbitration Relief: Except as provided in subsection (h) (No Class Actions), the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by the Company before an arbitrator was selected, the Company will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (ii) US$10,000. The arbitratorâs award shall be final and binding on all parties. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
<li>Fees: In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, or if the Company has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county and state of your residence unless we agree otherwise , provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic or video hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your residence. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitratorâs ruling on the merits.</li>
<li>No Class Actions: you and company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one personâs claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</li>
<li>Modifications to this Arbitration Provision: If the Company makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Companyâs address for Notice, in which case your account with the Company will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.</li>
<li>Enforceability: if only subsection (h) of this Section or the entirety of this Section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described elsewhere in Section 29 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Basically,</strong><br/>
<strong>It is our goal to quickly and efficiently resolve disputes that may arise. For that reason, we require disputes to be submitted to arbitration. If you bring a dispute in arbitration that is $10,000 or less, ClassDojo will pay all the filing fees and make arrangements for telephonic or video-based proceedings (if you prefer). Additionally, we each waive rights to bring class actions.</strong></p></div></details><details id="experimental-features" class="css-1f1vurp e15a1zu69"><summary><span class="nessie-text e15a1zu61 css-9zsane">Experimental Features</span></summary><div><p>We may provide experimental features for you to try.
