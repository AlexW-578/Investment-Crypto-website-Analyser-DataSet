EFFORTS BY ARCHIVE DIGGER TO MODIFY THE SERVICES SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A WAIVER OF THESE LIMITATIONS OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE TOS. Some jurisdictions limit or do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, and as a result some or all of this section may not apply to you. In cases where such laws apply, the warranties will be disclaimed only to fullest extent permitted by law.</p>
            <h2 id="limitation-of-liability">13. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL ARCHIVE DIGGER, ARCHIVE DIGGER CORPORATE GROUP, OR ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, INTERNAL OPERATING UNITS, AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, SUBLICENSEES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS, AND RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, WITH ARCHIVE DIGGER, AND THE ARCHIVE DIGGER CORPORATE GROUP, THE âARCHIVE DIGGER  ENTITIESâ) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE SAME, OR FOR ANY BREACH OF SECURITY, OR FOR ANY CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES OBTAINED THROUGH OR VIEWED ON THE SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF SAME, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, REGULATION, COMMON LAW PRECEDENT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE ARCHIVE DIGGER ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES AND EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM ANY ARCHIVE DIGGER ENTITYâS NEGLIGENCE OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ARCHIVE DIGGER ENTITIESâ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). ADDITIONAL DISCLAIMERS BY ARCHIVE DIGGER APPEAR WITHIN THE SERVICES AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH DISCLAIMERS PLACE GREATER RESTRICTIONS ON YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE MATERIAL CONTAINED THEREIN, SUCH GREATER RESTRICTIONS SHALL APPLY. Some jurisdictions restrict or do not allow the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you.

            <p>BY ACCESSING THIS SITE, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY BE WAIVING RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS THAT ARE AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN OR UNSUSPECTED, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH WAIVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE, THE BENEFITS OF SECTION 1542 OF THE CIVIL CODE OF CALIFORNIA, AND ANY SIMILAR LAW OF ANY STATE OR TERRITORY, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS:</p>

            <p>You hereby waive any and all rights you have or may have under California Civil Code Section 1542, and/or any similar provision of law or successor statute to it, with respect to any claims you may have in connection with this site or these TOS. In connection with this waiver and release, you acknowledge that you are aware that you may hereafter discover claims presently unknown or unsuspected, or facts in addition to or different from those which you now know or believe to be true. Nevertheless, you intend by these TOS to release fully, finally and forever all such matters under these TOS In furtherance of such intention, the releases set forth in these TOS shall be and shall remain in effect as full and complete releases notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or different claims or facts relevant hereto.</p>
            <p>If you are a resident of New Jersey, this section does not apply to prevent a right to recover certain damages (including punitive damages) where a harmed person proves with the required evidence that the harm suffered was the result of the defendantâs âacts or omissions and such acts or omissions were actuated by actual malice or accompanied by a wanton and willful disregard of persons who foreseeably might be harmed by those acts or omissions.â Similarly, this section does not limit Archive Diggerâs tort liability under New Jersey law resulting from Archive Diggerâs own intentional or reckless conduct.</p>
            <h2 id="governing-law">14. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>The TOS shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of New York, without giving effect to conflicts-of-law principles thereof. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York County in the State of New York with respect to any legal proceedings that may arise in connection with the Services or from a dispute as to the interpretation or breach of the TOS.</p>
            <h2 id="arbitration">15. Arbitration</h2>
            <p>By using this site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Archive Digger and/or Archive Digger Entities arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the website or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (âFAAâ), 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York; (4) the arbitratorâs decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these TOS and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the website; (5) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Archive Digger Entityâs individual claims, and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Archive Digger Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Archive Digger Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Archive Digger agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Archive Digger will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Archive Digger shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

            <p>These TOS constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between us and you regarding the Services, and these TOS supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between us and you regarding such topic. If we fail to enforce any part of these TOS, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these TOS by us must be made in writing and signed by us. If any provision of these TOS (or part of such provision) is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court having competent jurisdiction, then that provision (or part of that provision) shall be deemed severable from the TOS and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions â that invalid or unenforceable (part of the) clause will be replaced by a valid and/or enforceable, as the case may be, (part of the) clause which is as close to the intention of the parties as possible. All of our rights and obligations under these TOS (including any license rights) are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
