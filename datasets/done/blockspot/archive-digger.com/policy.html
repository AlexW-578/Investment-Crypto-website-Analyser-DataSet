            <p>We and third parties may use automated means to collect Information about you, your device, and your use of the App. We may do so through technologies that collect or transmit Information from the App (sometimes called âAPIsâ) or through technology embedded in the App (sometimes called âSDKsâ), which may be operated by us.</p>

            <h2 id="third-parties-and-online-analytics-providers">4. Third Parties and Online Analytics Providers</h2>
            <p>To help us better understand your use of the App, we may use <a href="/open-source">third-party</a> analytics on our App. These third parties use the sorts of technologies described in the âAutomatically Collected Informationâ section above. The information collected by this technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.</p>
            <p>The App may also contain link to third-party websites, applications, and services. If you choose to use those sites or services, you may disclose your Information to those third parties. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Archive Digger, we are not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your Information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third-party websites or services, and not this Privacy Policy. We urge you to read their privacy and security policies for additional information.</p>
            <h2 id="security">5. Security</h2>
            <p>We take technical and organizational measures to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is absolutely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <h2 id="children">6. Children</h2>
            <p>The App is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of sixteen (16). If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of sixteen (16) and believe we have unknowingly collected Information about your child, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@archive-digger.com">privacy@archive-digger.com</a> and we will investigate.</p>

            <p>California residents, under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Cal. Civil Code Â§ 1798.100 et seq. (the âCCPAâ), have the right to request that we (i) provide you with access to the Personal Information that we hold about you, (ii) correct your Personal Information, (iii) delete your Personal Information, and (iv) cease or restrict disclosures or sales of your Personal Information to third parties. You also have a right against discrimination for exercising any of these rights, which we are committed to upholding and honoring at all times.</p>

            <p><strong>Categories of Data that We Hold about You</strong></p>
            <p>We do not know your identity because we do not process your name, email address, or other identifiable information. Instead, we only process digital identifiers such as cookie IDs, IP addresses, mobile advertising IDs on your device, browsing history and associated preferences.</p>
            <p><strong>Why and Where your Personal Information is Collected</strong></p>
            <p>We process your Personal Information in order to provide personalized content to you. We automatically collect user Information when users interact with the App.</p>
            <p><strong>How Your Personal Information is Shared</strong></p>
            <p>We may disclose or make available your pseudonymous Personal Information to our trusted partners. When we do so, we have contractually restricted their uses of this data for only Taboolaâs business purposes. Under the CCPA, such disclosures of Personal Information to service providers are not deemed to be a âsale.â</p>
            <h2 id="notice-to-international-users">8. Notice to International Users</h2>
            <p>Archive Digger, Inc. operates in the United States and as a result, the Information we collect will be used only for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and will be stored in the United States. By using the App, you acknowledge and consent that we may transfer your Information outside the country in which it is collected, including to a country that may not offer the same level of protection for Information as the country in which you reside. Rest assured however, that our parent company has arranged all contractual safeguards to ensure your Information is processed in a way that offers an adequate level of protection when it is transferred or shared between or among Archive Diggerâs Affiliates, subsidiaries, and/or parent companies.</p>
