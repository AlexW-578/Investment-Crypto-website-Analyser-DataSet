Use of the SaaS Service is subject to the Subscription Specifications provided in the applicable Order Form executed by the Parties pursuant to these Online Terms.</p><p>Customer shall not permit any third party to access the SaaS Service except as expressly permitted herein or in the applicable Order Form.

It is Customer’s responsibility to maintain and promptly update this account information to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

Customer is solely responsible for all of the activity that occurs in Customer’s tenant. Every User must keep account passwords secure. BlueConic will not be liable for, as expressly disclaims any and all liability related directly or indirectly to, any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account or tenant.</p><h2>Eligibility</h2><p>Each Party warrants that it is authorized to enter into the Parties’ Agreement and that it (and its Users) will act in compliance with the Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Any use of or access to the SaaS Service by anyone under age 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of the Agreement. Users previously removed from the SaaS Service by BlueConic cannot use the SaaS Service.</p><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, BlueConic reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse to permit any individual or entity to register as a Customer or as a User.</p><h2>Access and Accounts</h2><p>The SaaS Service will be hosted via Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) in the region(s) specified in the applicable Order Form. Customer is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining, at its own expense, all equipment needed to access the SaaS Service, including but not limited to internet access, adequate bandwidth, and encryption technology.</p><p>Access is limited to the version of the SaaS Service in BlueConic’s production environment. BlueConic regularly updates the SaaS Service and reserves the right to discontinue, add and/or substitute functionality equivalent features in the event of product unavailability, end-of-life, or changes to secure Customer Data against accidental or unlawful loss, access, or disclosure. BlueConic will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the SaaS Service generally available for Customer’s use.</p><p>During the applicable Term of the Agreement, BlueConic will provide Customer with certain support and maintenance for the optimal use of the SaaS Service.

No rights are granted to Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein and agreed by the Parties.</p><p>The SaaS Service, including without limitation all BlueConic Content and any Intellectual Property Rights related thereto or derivative of the foregoing, provided by BlueConic in the performance of the SaaS Service, shall remain the exclusive, sole, and absolute property of BlueConic and its licensors. For the avoidance of doubt, by executing an Order Form pursuant to these Online Terms, Customer does not acquire any right, title, or interest in or to the SaaS Service, BlueConic Content, or any of BlueConic’s Intellectual Property Rights.</p><h2>Customer’s Proprietary Rights</h2><p>As between BlueConic and Customer, Customer exclusively owns all right, title, and interest in and to all Customer Data. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer Data shall include all data generated or supplied by Customer’s subscribers or customers. BlueConic and its subcontractors are provided a royalty-free, fully paid, perpetual, sub-licensable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to the Customer Data for the sole and exclusive purpose of (i) providing the Services to Customer in accordance with these Online Terms; and (ii) developing, benchmarking, maintaining, supporting, and improving the SaaS Service, and preparing aggregate reporting about the SaaS Service (so long as any Customer Data is not reasonably identifiable with an individual).</p><h2>Customer Feedback</h2><p>BlueConic and its licensors shall have a royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, perpetual license to use or incorporate into the SaaS Service any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or other feedback provided by Customer, including its Users, relating to the operation and performance of the SaaS Service. Customer further acknowledges that BlueConic does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to BlueConic, or developed by its officers, employees, contractors, agents, or other representatives, or otherwise obtained from sources other than Customer.</p><h2>Free Access Subscriptions</h2><p>If Customer receives access to a tenant providing the SaaS Service for free (a “Free Access Subscription”), or access to a tenant solely designated for development purposes (a “Sandbox”), then Customer may use the Free Access Subscription and/or Sandbox in accordance with these Online Terms, including, without limitation, the usage restrictions as set forth on the BlueConic Website, the policies set forth in the “Fair Use” Section below, or any other restrictions that are conveyed to Customer from time to time by BlueConic. All Free Access Subscriptions and access to Sandboxes are subject to change from time to time by BlueConic in its sole discretion without prior notice. Changes may include (i) the termination of the provision of certain features of the SaaS Service, either to Customer or to other BlueConic customers; or (ii) changes to or the creation of usage limits, policies, or other restrictions on the use of the SaaS Service. BlueConic may immediately suspend, revoke, or terminate a Free Access Subscription or right to access a Sandbox at any time, for any reason, without liability to either Party. BlueConic does not guarantee that Sandboxes or Free Access Subscriptions will be made available in the future under the same commercial terms that currently are available (or that are made available in the future). BlueConic may use all Customer Data collected via the Free Access Subscription for testing purposes and to provide recommendations for optimal use of the tool. Customer acknowledges that the Free Access Subscription or Sandbox may not be complete or fully functional and may contain bugs, errors, omissions, and other problems.</p><p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING IN THESE ONLINE TERMS TO THE CONTRARY, ALL FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND SANDBOXES OF THE SAAS SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND BLUECONIC WILL HAVE NO LIABILITY, WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, OR SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WITH RESPECT TO FREE ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS, SANDBOXES, OR BETA RELEASES.</p><h2>Fair Use Policy for Free Access Subscription</h2><p>You are welcome to register for a Free Access Subscription to use the SaaS Service. BlueConic enforces certain limits on the number of profiles and other volume and usage metrics you are allowed to store and/or generate when granted access to a tenant based on a Free Access Subscription. By using a Free Access Subscription to the SaaS Service, you will create a stream of data, storage, and traffic on the network and infrastructure of BlueConic and its third-party suppliers. To prevent excessive use of this capacity by Users, certain fair use policies (which are subject to change by BlueConic from time to time), are applicable to any party with a Free Access Subscription.</p><p>The fair use policies specified in these Online Terms, are subject to change from time to time by BlueConic in its sole discretion.</p><h2>Applicable Terms for Paid Subscriptions</h2><h2>Fees and Payment Terms</h2><p>The Parties will be deemed to have agreed upon a “Paid Subscription” to the SaaS Service upon the execution of an Order Form incorporating these Online Terms.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, payment of invoiced fees is due thirty (30) days after the invoice date. The payment obligations for the SaaS Service shall start as of the Implementation Date stated in the applicable Order Form. Further, Customer agrees that its purchases hereunder are neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, nor dependent on any oral or written comments made by BlueConic regarding future functionality or features. At the end of each 12-month period during any Term, BlueConic may modify the SaaS Service fees agreed upon in the applicable Order Form; provided, however, that BlueConic will not increase the fees by more than the cumulative annual changes to the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (“HICP”), issued from time to time by the European Central Bank or any successor agency that shall issue such HICP, during the preceding twelve (12) month period plus seven and a half (7.5%) percent. The foregoing price adjustment assumes that upon the start of any renewal Term, Customer’s Subscription limits and volumes will remain at the same levels agreed upon for the Term immediately preceding such renewal Term. Should Customer’s usage of the Subscription have materially increased beyond the then agreed upon limits, sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the then current Term, the Parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations to revise the Subscription fees for the renewal Term.</p><p>The payment obligations for the SaaS Service shall start as of the Implementation Date stated in the applicable Order Form. Amounts paid or payable for the SaaS Service are not contingent upon the performance of any Implementation Services. Further, Customer agrees that its purchases hereunder are neither contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, nor dependent on any oral or written comments made by BlueConic regarding future functionality or features. Any amounts not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is less.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified in an Order Form, BlueConic’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales and use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal, or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for the payment of all Taxes (excluding those on BlueConic’s net income) relating to the provision of the Services. In the event that Customer is tax exempt, such evidence shall be provided to BlueConic at the time of execution of any Order Form.</p><h2>No Refunds</h2><p>Customer shall receive no refund or exchange for any unused Services or unused fees of the Subscription. All fees are based on the Services purchased hereunder and not actual usage.</p><h2>Subscription Terms</h2><p>Customer acknowledges and agrees that it shall be responsible for paying all fees due for the full Term of its Paid Subscription as agreed in each applicable Order Form, whether or not Customer cancels such Paid Subscription prior to the end of such Term. Customer further acknowledges and agrees that the Term of its Paid Subscription shall automatically renew for additional successive terms equal to the period of the initial Term unless Customer provides BlueConic with notice of its intent not to renew the Paid Subscription at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current Subscription Term.</p><h2>Collection, Use, and Security of Customer Data</h2><p>Customer understands that the technical processing and transmission of the Customer Data is fundamentally necessary in order to perform the Services. Customer expressly consents to BlueConic’s interception and storage of Customer’s electronic communications and/or Customer Data, and Customer acknowledges and understands that this will involve transmission over the internet, and over various networks, the security of which cannot be guaranteed by BlueConic.</p><p>If BlueConic processes any personal data on Customer’s behalf when performing BlueConic’s obligations under this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree that Customer shall be the data controller and BlueConic shall be a data processor. BlueConic shall process Customer Data in accordance with applicable law and, if applicable, the terms of a Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”) executed by the Parties. If the Parties do execute a DPA in accordance with these Online Terms, the DPA, along with the Order Form and any other applicable attachments, shall be incorporated into the Parties’ Agreement.</p><p>Additionally, Customer shall ensure that Customer is entitled to transfer the relevant personal data to BlueConic so that BlueConic may lawfully use, process, and transfer the personal data in accordance with this Agreement on Customer’s behalf. Further, Customer shall ensure that the relevant third parties (such as members of Customer’s audience) have given their consent to such use, processing, and transfer of all personal data supplied by Customer as required by all applicable data protection laws, rules, and regulations. BlueConic takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any Customer Data (including personal data or content) that Customer or any other User or third party provides, posts, publishes, or transmits over the SaaS Service.</p><p>Customer consents to the appointment of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Pendo.io, Inc. (“Pendo”) as sub-processors under the Parties’ Agreement. BlueConic enlists AWS to host the BlueConic SaaS Serivce. BlueConic enlists Pendo to collect data on User behavior and interactions within Customer’s instance of the BlueConic SaaS Service. For clarity, Pendo does not process Customer Data that is loaded into the SaaS Service, nor does Pendo track or monitor your customers’ interactions with your brand outside of the BlueConic interface. Pendo is solely a product improvement tool to enhance your BlueConic experience. BlueConic remains fully liable to Customer for all the acts and/or omissions of sub-processors that result in a breach of this Agreement by BlueConic and/or a BlueConic Affiliate. Sub-processors operate on behalf of BlueConic in accordance with the Online Service Documentation. BlueConic takes steps to ensure the reliability of personnel, suppliers, and sub-processors who may process Customer Data and ensure that all such personnel are bound by a duly enforceable contractual or statutory duty of confidence to maintain the confidentiality of the Customer Data and process Customer Data in accordance with BlueConic’s security policies</p><p>Customer will not engage in any of the following prohibited intentional activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the SaaS Service in any medium (except as expressly permitted herein), including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) transmitting spam or other unsolicited email using the SaaS Service, or using the SaaS Service to communicate any unlawful, harmful, offensive, threatening, abusive, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, profane, hateful, sexually explicit, racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable material of any sort, including, without limitation, any material that encourages conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable law, rule or regulation; (iii) interfere with or compromise the system integrity or security of the SaaS Service (including, without limitation, attempting to access the tenant or account of any other customer of BlueConic) or to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the SaaS Service; (iv) intentionally uploading viruses, worms, malicious code or other harmful software agents through the SaaS Service; (v) use the SaaS Service to impersonate another person or otherwise misrepresent the affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide the identity; (vi) accessing any content on the SaaS Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the SaaS Service; or (vii) bypassing the measures BlueConic may use to prevent or restrict access to the SaaS Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the SaaS Service or the content therein. Customer is solely responsible for the legality, reliability, integrity, accuracy, and quality of the Customer Data.</p><p>Customer represents and warrants that it will: (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its activities under these Online Terms; (ii) obtain and maintain all necessary licenses, consents, permits and permissions necessary for BlueConic, its subsidiaries, contractors, affiliates, suppliers, and agents, to use the Customer Data in the performance of the SaaS Service; (iii) ensure that Customer’s Users use the SaaS Service, Online Service Documentation on the BlueConic Website, and all data obtained from the use of the SaaS Service in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Online Terms and shall be responsible for any Users’ violation of the Online Terms (as if such violation had been committed by Customer itself); and (iv) assume sole responsibility for its and its Users’ use of any data obtained from the use of the SaaS Service, and for conclusions drawn from such use.</p><p>BlueConic may suspend Customer’s access and use of the SaaS Service immediately, with prompt notice provided to Customer, if, and so long as, in BlueConic’s sole judgment, there is a security or legal risk created by Customer that may interfere with the continued lawful provision of the SaaS Service or the operation of BlueConic’s network or systems.</p><p>During the Term of the Agreement, BlueConic will: (i) store the Customer Data in the format(s) specified in the Online Service Documentation; (ii) enable Customer to access the Customer Data electronically; and (iii) enable Customer to export and/or download the Customer Data from the SaaS Service at any time.</p><p>Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, and for a reasonable time thereafter, Customer may request BlueConic’s assistance to transfer the Customer Data from the SaaS Service to a third-party application. If Customer requests transition assistance, and BlueConic is willing to perform such work, the transition services will be subject to an agreement of the fees to be paid in advance to BlueConic.</p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2><p>To learn more about how BlueConic protects your privacy, please visit the Privacy Policy on the BlueConic Website.</p><h2>Confidentiality</h2><p>“Confidential Information” of either Party will mean information disclosed to or learned by the receiving Party concerning the disclosing Party’s business, customers, products, proposed products, plans, inventions, processes, and techniques, which information is designated as “Confidential”, “Proprietary” or some similar designation, or should reasonably be considered to be confidential or proprietary due to its nature or the context of its disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach on the part of the receiving Party; (ii) the receiving Party obtains from a third party rightfully, without breach of nondisclosure obligations and without restriction on disclosure; (iii) the disclosing Party regularly provides to others without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information.</p><p>Except as explicitly authorized in writing by these Online Terms or otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, each Party will: (a) not use, for its own benefit or the benefit of any third party, the other Party’s Confidential Information; (b) only disclose Confidential Information to its employees and agents (who are bound by obligations of confidentiality consistent with those set forth in this Section) having a need to know such information in connection with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to the Agreement; and (c) use reasonable care, but in no event less than a commercially reasonable standard of care, to protect the other Party’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use, disclosure, and publication. Both Parties acknowledge and agree that the breach of this Section could cause great or irreparable injury to the disclosing Party and that pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief, and therefore, that upon any such unauthorized disclosure by the receiving Party, the disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law. Within fourteen (14) days after termination of this Agreement, each receiving Party shall destroy or deliver to the disclosing Party, at the disclosing Party’s option, all materials in the receiving Party’s possession or control that contain or disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party.</p><p>Additionally, the receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information if compelled to do so by law; provided, however, that the receiving Party notifies the disclosing Party in writing without undue delay in advance of such disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and provides the disclosing Party with reasonable assistance, at the disclosing Party’s sole cost and expense, if the disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the receiving Party still must disclose the Confidential Information, the receiving Party will share only that specific portion of Confidential Information as legally required (on advisement of its legal counsel) and will take commercially reasonable measures to afford such disclosure confidential treatment.</p><h2>Non-Conformance and Errors</h2><p>Only with regard to a Paid Subscription of the SaaS Service (and not with regard to any Free Subscription Access or Sandbox), BlueConic warrants that the SaaS Service will perform substantially in accordance with this Agreement, the Online Service Documentation, and any applicable Order Form(s) and/or Statement(s) of Work. BlueConic shall not be responsible to correct a non-conformance, if such non-conformance is solely caused by use of the SaaS Service contrary to these Online Terms, the Online Service Documentation, any applicable Order Form(s) and/or Statement(s) of Work, or BlueConic’s instructions, or is otherwise due to the modification or alteration of the SaaS Service by Customer, not approved by BlueConic. In case of an Error that occurs during Customer’s paid usage of the SaaS Service, which is made known by Customer to BlueConic, BlueConic will at its sole discretion, use reasonable commercial efforts to correct any such non-conformance, or will provide Customer with an alternative means of meeting such specifications, at no additional charge to Customer.</p><h2>Additional Services (other than the SaaS Service)</h2><p>BlueConic or other third parties may, from time to time, make available to Customer products and/or services, including but not limited to non-standard and/or non-BlueConic applications, plug-ins, customizations and implementation, or other consulting services (collectively “Other Services”). Any installation or enablement by Customer (or on behalf of Customer) of Other Services, and any exchange of data between Customer and any of such Other Service, is solely between Customer and the applicable provider. If BlueConic is the provider of Other Services to Customer, the provision of Other Services shall be pursuant to a separate agreement.</p><p>If non-standard applications, plug-ins, or customizations are installed or enabled by Customer (or on behalf of Customer for use with the SaaS Service), Customer acknowledges that BlueConic may allow providers of those non-standard applications, plug-ins, or customizations to access the Customer Data as required for the interoperation of such non-standard applications, plug-ins, or customizations with the SaaS Service. BlueConic shall not be responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of Customer Data resulting from any such access by the providers of non-standard applications, plug-ins, or customizations. The SaaS Service shall allow Customer to restrict such access by restricting Users from installing or enabling such non-standard applications, plug-ins, or customizations for use with the SaaS Service.</p><p>The SaaS Service may contain features designed to interoperate with non-BlueConic applications (for example Google, Facebook, or Twitter). To use such features, Customer may be required to obtain access to such non-BlueConic applications from their providers. If the provider of any such non-BlueConic application ceases to make the non-BlueConic application available for interoperation with the corresponding service features on reasonable terms, BlueConic may cease providing such service features without entitling Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation.</p><p>The SaaS Service may contain links to other websites (“Linked Websites”). Those links are provided for your convenience and reference only and may not remain current or be maintained. BlueConic does not control Linked Websites and is not responsible for the content or privacy practices associated with any of the Linked Websites. BlueConic reserves the right to terminate the links at any time. Linked Websites should not be construed as an endorsement, approval, or recommendation by BlueConic of the owners or operators of the Linked Websites, or of any information, graphics, materials, products, or services referred to or contained on those Linked Websites. BlueConic is not liable or responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of any material contained in any third-party websites, and Customer hereby irrevocably waives any claims that it may have against BlueConic with respect to such websites.</p><h2>Representations, Warranties, and Disclaimers</h2><p>Each Party represents and warrants that such Party has full right, power, and authority to enter into and perform their obligations under the Agreement without the consent of any third party. Each Party further represents and warrants that it will use industry standard methods to prevent the transmission to the other party of any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancel bots or other computer programming routines that damage (or are intended to damage), detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept, or expropriate any system, data, or personal information.</p><p>BlueConic represents and warrants that it will perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with the applicable specifications and requirements set forth in this Agreement and any applicable Online Service Documentation. BlueConic further represents, warrants, and covenants that it is the sole owner of the SaaS Service and that it has obtained and will maintain adequate rights, licenses, and authorizations thereto as required to fulfill its performance obligations herein and that the SaaS Service does not infringe, contributorily infringe, or misappropriate any intellectual property or proprietary right of any third party.

The GDPR is a new European Union (“EU”) law that regulates the personal data of individuals in the EU. The GDPR harmonizes data privacy and security rules across Europe and introduces changes that require companies to update their privacy and security policies and practices.</p><h4>Does the GDPR cover Jebbit’s data?</h4><p>Jebbit has evaluated its services, and some of them are likely subject to the GDPR. The GDPR applies to the personal data of individuals in the EU, which is defined as any type of information that identifies or can be linked to an individual. In addition to the usual types of personal data (i.e., name, address, phone number, email), this definition can also include information such as online identifiers and any data tied to those identifiers.</p><h4>What efforts has Jebbit taken to prepare for the GDPR?</h4><p>We have made GDPR a priority, and have reviewed and adjusted specific practices in ways intended to meet relevant GDPR requirements. For much of the data we process, we serve as a service provider (known as a “processor” under the GDPR) and we abide by the contractual commitments we have with our customers in this capacity.</p><p>For more information on our privacy practices, please review our updated privacy policy, found above on this page.</p><h4>What are Jebbit’s customers’ responsibilities under the GDPR?</h4><p>Our brand, publisher, and agency customers with EU end users who offer goods or services in the EU may be required to comply with the regulation. If they fall under the Regulation, these customers must have a lawful basis for processing data, have in place measures to carry out EU data subjects’ rights requests, and provide adequate data security, among other requirements. Unfortunately, we cannot advise you as to whether you need to comply with the GDPR.</p><h4>Will Jebbit’s services change for the GDPR?</h4><p>Our services will not fundamentally change due to the GDPR. However, we continuously look to improve our services and, as we make updates to our services as offered in the EU, we will do so with GDPR in mind.</p><h3>CCPA FAQ</h3><h4>What is The California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA” ?</h4><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) of 2018 has fundamentally changed the way brands are approaching consumer consent and its importance to doing business seamlessly across the USA. Like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), CCPA necessitates changes to how brands treat consumers’ data privacy. The CCPA’s requirements will go into effect on July 1st, 2020.</p><p>In simplest terms, CCPA requires brands to enable three critical functions:</p><ul><li><p>The right to knowledge. Consumers have the right to know:</p></li><li><p>What information a company is collecting about them</p></li><li><p>How that information will be used</p></li><li><p>If and with whom that information will be shared</p></li><li><p>The right to be forgotten – With some exceptions, companies must delete all the information they have about a consumer at the consumer’s request</p></li><li><p>The right to control who has access to their information – Consumers must be able to opt out of the sale of their information to third parties.</p></li></ul><h4>How personal information is defined</h4><p>The CCPA interprets personal information broadly to include any information that “identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.” Crucially for marketers, this includes behavioral data from digital interactions between consumers and the brand, as well as any inferences the company draws from that data, such as a consumer’s preferences or buyer persona.</p><p>It’s also important to note that personal information does not need to be matched up with a person’s name—as long as that information can be identified as belonging to a unique individual, it doesn’t matter if the company can identify that individual by name or by another unique identifier, such as an IP address.</p><h4>GDPR, CCPA and Jebbit’s compliance</h4><p>Below is a summary table for the key requirements in GDPR and CCPA and the measures that Jebbit has taken to comply with both.</p><div class="post-img pt-4 pb-5 rounded"><img class="img-fluid" src="//images.ctfassets.net/cffoc7tw1rd0/4oE3bVMF5btu4eQ8CRpmkm/3bc80e896f33cdb22b87b678c6945ae2/Jebbity_GDPR___CCPA.png?w=748&fm=jpg&q=85" alt="" /></div><p></p>
