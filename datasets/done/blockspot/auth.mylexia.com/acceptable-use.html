Acceptable Use Policy
</div>
    
<p>Lexia Learning Systems LLC., wholly-owned subsidiary of Lexia Voyager Sopris Inc., and Cambium Learning Group company (â<b>Lexia</b>â), provides educational SaaS-based and/or SaaS-supported subscriptions, applications, products, services and materials (hereafter, â<b>Lexia Service(s)</b>â) that are designed to support classroom instruction and learning, and educator professional learning.</p>

<p>All Lexia Services are provided as enterprise offerings under Lexiaâs standard <b>Application License</b> to Lexiaâs school district, state agency, LEA and other public or private educational organization customers (each, a â<b>Sponsoring Agency</b>â), with which Lexia has entered into license and services agreement terms for the Lexia Services (each, the â<b>Services Agreement</b>â). </p>

<p>This Acceptable Use Policy (this â<b>AUP</b>â or these â<b>Terms</b>â), is an agreement between you, the individual adult learner or user accessing and/or using a Lexia Service (as defined herein), and Lexia, and provides general terms and conditions applicable to your use of the Lexia Services.  </p>    
    
<p>This AUP is incorporated and made part of the Lexia Application License and Services Agreement between Lexia and the Sponsoring Agency customer through which you receive your access to the Lexia Service, governs your access to and use of the Lexia Service, and any software, applications, audio, video, graphs, curriculum, user guides, resources, information, content, text, downloadable or print materials, graphics, images, photos, or other materials (individually and collectively, â<b>Content</b>â) uploaded, downloaded, posted, or otherwise appearing on or made available to you through the Lexia Service.  Additional terms, policies, or product requirements may apply to individual Lexia Services as provided with the relevant Lexia Service.</p>    
    
<div class="box_simple"><p>For clarity, nothing in this AUP is intended to supersede or limit rights expressly granted to you under the terms of the written Services Agreement that your Sponsoring Agency has entered into with Lexia regarding your access to and use of the Lexia Services.  In addition, nothing in this AUP is intended to deprive any Sponsoring Agency or user of any sovereign immunity protections or rights expressly mandated under applicable law that are required for the Lexia Services and use thereof under the applicable Services Agreement with the Sponsoring Agency.  <b>In the event of a conflict between any term of this AUP and the terms and conditions of your Sponsoring Agencyâs Services Agreement with Lexia for the Lexia Service(s), the terms and conditions of the written Services Agreement between Lexia and your Sponsoring Agency shall control with respect to such conflicting term.</b></p></div>

<p>Please review this AUP carefully.  If you do not agree to the terms of this AUP, you should not access or use the Lexia Services.  By accessing, downloading, or using the Lexia Services, you agree to the terms of this AUP.

    <br>
<span id="section">1. Limited license</span>

You understand that your use of the Lexia Services does not confer to you any intellectual property rights held by Lexia or its licensors. Unless otherwise indicated, any future release, update, or other addition to functionality or content of the Lexia Services will be subject to this AUP.</p>

<p>When you access and use Lexia Services, whether as an adult learner or participant user, as an account administrator user, or otherwise, you do so as a user under a limited enterprise license, where the Sponsoring Agency -- not you as the individual user â is the Lexia customer and licensee of the Lexia Services, and where the Sponsoring Agency is the controller with respect to all user and usage data, data reporting, and data processing, associated with your access and use of the Lexia Services.</p>

<p>You understand that Lexia acts as an educational service provider to the Sponsoring Agency, under the authority and instruction of the Sponsoring Agency customer with respect to Lexiaâs delivery and performance of, and your access and use of, Lexia Services, and with respect to data pertaining to you that is processed by Lexia in relation to the Lexia Services.</p>

<p>You understand that Lexia may at any time provide access, reporting and other information relating to your access and use of Lexia Services to the Sponsoring Agency, including, but not limited to, information relating to you, your Lexia Service usage, attendance, progress, participation, Lexia Service certifications, transcripts or scores, contributions, responses to surveys,  communications or interactions you may have with Lexia personnel or other users within or with respect to the Lexia Services, and including any information relating to your compliance with this AUP and/or allegations or findings of non-compliance, without notice or other obligation or liability to you.</p>
