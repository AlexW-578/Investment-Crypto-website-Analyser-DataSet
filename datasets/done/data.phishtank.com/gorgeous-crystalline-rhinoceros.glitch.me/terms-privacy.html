In this regard, there is also the possibility that employees of IONOS or a service provider manually check the results in individual cases. The legal basis for data processing in the context of &quot;device fingerprinting&quot; is the legitimate interest, as there is a legitimate interest on the part of IONOS to protect itself against fraud and/or misuse.</p><p class="content-paragraph">The usage data processed in the context of fraud prevention are, for example, IP addresses, information on website calls as well as information on the temporal scope of the websites visited. The device and browser data used in the context of &quot;device fingerprinting&quot; are, for example, language and country settings, browser, screen information, plug-ins, software versions. Transaction data, such as the object of purchase, shopping cart, name, postal address, e-mail address, delivery address, payment method and bank data, are also processed. This data is processed exclusively for reasons of abuse and fraud prevention.</p><p class="content-paragraph">On the basis of the aforementioned device data, a <strong>device ID</strong> is first created, which can be used to recognize end devices when they visit the website again. A cookie is set so that we can recognize this. The cookie contains a <strong>cookie ID</strong>, but no personal usage or transaction data. This allows the device to be identified without knowing the person behind it by name or linking it to the device ID.</p><p class="content-paragraph">In the event that the matching process described above is successful, i.e., if fraud or a corresponding fraud attempt has already been made via the respective device in the past, a contract is refused in the specific individual case.</p><p class="content-paragraph">In order to optimize fraud prevention processes, your data will be transmitted to ThreatMetrix (see <a href="https://www.ionos.co.uk/terms-gtc/privacy-policy/" title="https://www.ionos.co.uk/terms-gtc/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" class="link-standard">below</a> for information and contact details of the service provider/sub-service provider used) if you have given your consent. There, personal data is stored in a pseudo-mymized form in a pool in which pseudo-mymized data of other ThreatMetrix customers is also stored. This serves in particular to prevent terminal-related, cross-border waves of attacks or mass attacks with possible abuse or fraud backgrounds at an early stage. Your data is only checked there to determine whether there might be any suspicion of fraud or misuse. ThreatMetrix may also provide suspicious device IDs to other companies for fraud prevention reasons, e.g. also to companies located in a third country without an adequate level of data protection. The legal basis for a data transfer for fraud screening is your consent.</p><p class="content-paragraph">However, this consent is only requested if you wish to place your order online. If you do not wish to give such consent to the data processing for risk assessment, within the framework of fraud prevention, an online order is unfortunately not possible. Alternatively, however, you can continue to place your order with us by telephone.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Cancellation option:</strong></p><p class="content-paragraph">If you have given us your consent under data protection law, you can revoke this consent at any time via<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@IONOS.co.uk." title="privacypolicy@IONOS.co.uk." class="link-standard"></a><a href="mailto:" title=" privacypolicy@IONOS.co.uk" target="privacypolicy@IONOS.co.uk" class="link-standard">privacypolicy@IONOS.co.uk</a>&nbsp;with effect for the future. This revocation will also be transmitted to ThreatMetrix, so that you can also have your data deleted there at any time.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Your data will be transmitted to the following service providers for fraud prevention purposes:</strong></p><p class="content-paragraph">In order to carry out the measures described above, we have commissioned CRIF Bürgel GmbH, Radlkoferstraße 2, 81373 Munich as a service provider, which has subcontracted ThreatMetrix B.V, The Base 3/F, Tower C, Evert van de Beekstraat 1, 1118 CL Schiphol, The Netherlands for parts of the data processing, in particular the creation of the device ID. Data processing (including data storage) by CRIF Bürgel GmbH as well as ThreatMetrix takes place in data centers in Germany and Europe. CRIF Bürgel acts exclusively as an order processor and according to the instructions of IONOS.</p><p class="content-paragraph">With regard to the storage of pseudonymized data in an overarching data pool, ThreatMetrix acts as an autonomous entity. The data ThreatMetrix receives is encrypted with an individual key from IONOS, so that ThreatMetrix has no access to transmitted clear data. All data transfers between IONOS, CRIF Bürgel GmbH and ThreatMetrix are SSL-encrypted according to the state of the art.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>Storage period/criteria for determining the storage period:</strong></p><p class="content-paragraph">The data collected in the context of fraud prevention is stored for a maximum of six months for reasons of traceability, process optimization and response to customer inquiries, after which it is deleted.</p><p class="content-paragraph">&nbsp;</p></div>

The sending of e-mails of an advertising nature takes place exclusively in consideration of a consent given elsewhere for an advertising contact. In this context, Pardot MAS makes it possible to track your interactions with e-mails. This includes, for example, the so-called link evaluation regarding your click behavior within an email. Pardot MAS records whether and when a link was clicked and can assign this information to the respective e-mail recipient.</p><p class="content-paragraph">In addition, Pardot MAS also enables us to track the extent to which individuals have interacted with our website, clicked on certain links and/or registered in forms.

For this purpose, we have integrated the offer of Aklamio GmbH on our website via a direct link. If you click on the link &quot;Customers recruit customers @powered by Aklamio&quot;, you will be redirected to the Aklamio website.

Here it is sometimes necessary to forward personal data to the product partners. This is the case, for example, when registering a domain or issuing an SSL certificate. The contracts required by data protection law are concluded with our product partners. We only cooperate with partners who comply with our data protection standards. If a transfer of data to third countries takes place, the legal requirements that are placed on third country transfers are ensured.<br /> The legal basis is the fulfillment of the contract.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><strong>8.6.1 <u>Partner Portals of the IONOS Partner Programs</u></strong></p><p class="content-paragraph">With the Partner Portals of the IONOS Partner Programs (agency partner program, ISV partner program and consulting partner program), partners (e.g. freelancers, agencies, ISVs, consulting companies, system houses, etc.) can easily and clearly manage IONOS products for their end customers and access them directly in order to perform services, such as administering a server or designing a MyWebsite. The prerequisite for using this function is the consent given in advance by the end customer. Also, partners can publish their own contact information in a freely accessible online directory in order to be found and contacted by potential end customers. IONOS and the partners are independent contractual partners. The legal relationship between partner and end customer is completely independent of IONOS. IONOS collects, processes and uses a user's personal data without further consent, insofar as it is necessary for the establishment and processing of the contract.</p><p class="content-paragraph">To store your data as a user of the partner portal, we use the Salesforce CRM tool from salesforce.com Germany GmbH, Erika-Mann-Str. 31-37, 80636 Munich, which belongs to Salesforce Inc (“Salesforce”), Salesforce Tower, 415 Mission Street, 3rd Floor San Francisco, CA 94105, USA. In the event that personal data is transferred to a third country, such as the USA, we have appropriate guarantees within the meaning of Article 44 GDPR in place, such as the conclusion of standard contractual clauses with Salesforce.</p><p class="content-paragraph">In addition, binding corporate rules still apply at Salesforce.

For example, if your data is required for an active contract or for our accounting and statutory responsibilities.</p><p class="content-paragraph"><u><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong></u></p><p class="content-paragraph">You can request that we restrict the processing of your data in the following cases:</p><p class="content-paragraph">-You have disputed the accuracy of data and you want us to stop using it pending final verification</p><p class="content-paragraph">-The processing is unlawful, but you would prefer to restrict processing rather than have the data erased</p><p class="content-paragraph">-We no longer need and would otherwise delete the data, but you still need it for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims</p><p class="content-paragraph">-You have lodged an objection to the data processing, which is still under review</p><p class="content-paragraph">In the event of a restriction, we will ensure that the personal data cannot be further processed or changed by us.

You can object to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising at any time without providing a reason. If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes. To exercise your right to object, you must submit an objection to us, the data controller. In some cases you can do this directly online (e.g. in the case of cookies) or in the IONOS Control Panel (e.g. for advertising).
