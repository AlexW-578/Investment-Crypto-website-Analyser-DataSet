            <strong>14. Termination.</strong>
            We may terminate or suspend your access to the Site or any portion thereof and remove any material
            (including User Information) from the Site, in our sole
            discretion, at any time for any reason without notice to you. Further, if we believe, in our sole
            discretion, that a violation of these Terms of Use has
            occurred, we may take any other corrective action we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to investigate
            suspected violations of these Terms of Use,
            including without limitation any violation arising from any User Information. We may seek to gather
            information from a user who is suspected of violating
            these Terms of Use (or from any other user) and you agree to provide us with such information. We will fully
            cooperate with any law enforcement authorities
            or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting, publishing, or
            otherwise making available any User Information,
            emails, or other materials that are believed to violate these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>

            You may request cancellation of your Account at any time and for any reason by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@globaltekforex.com">support@globaltekforex.com</a>. Any suspension, termination, or
            cancellation shall not affect your obligations to Globaltek Forex under these Terms of Use (including but not
            limited to ownership, indemnification, and
            limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension,
            termination, or cancellation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>16. Waiver and Severability.</strong>
            Any waiver of any provision contained in these Terms of Use shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any other
            right, term or provision of these Terms of Use.
            If any provision in these Terms of Use shall be or become wholly or partially invalid, illegal or
            unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the
            extent it is legal and valid and the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall
            in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>17. Choice of law.</strong>
            These Terms of Use shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom of
            America and where applicable the State of New
            York, excluding that body of law pertaining to conflict of laws. You agree that the federal court of the New
            York, if it has subject matter jurisdiction,
            will have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine any claims or disputes between you and Globaltek Forex,
            pertaining directly or indirectly to these Terms
            of Use, or to any matter arising from these Terms of Use, or any other document executed and delivered in
            connection with these Terms of Use, the use of
            the Site or the online services offered by Globaltek Forex. If the federal court lacks subject matter
            jurisdiction, any state court located in New York, New
            York, will have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine such claims or disputes. To the fullest extent
            permitted by applicable state and federal law,
            you and Globaltek Forex each agree to waive the constitutional right to a trial before a jury. You agree that
            these Terms of Use and the rules, restrictions,
            and policies contained herein, and Globaltek Forexâs enforcement thereof, are not intended to confer and do not
            confer any rights or remedies on any person
            other than you and Globaltek Forex. These Terms of Use together with the rules and policies of Globaltek Forex
            constitute the entire agreement between Globaltek Forex and

            Site, any portion thereof, or any content
            thereon without advance notice, or to modify these Terms of Use. All modified terms of use will be effective
            upon the date when the change takes effect,
            unless there is a material change, which will be effective when Globaltek Forex provides notice to you, unless a
            longer notice period is required by applicable
            law. If any modified terms of use are not acceptable to you, your sole remedy is to cease using the Site,
            and if applicable, cancel your Account (defined
            below) as specified below. By continuing to access or use the Site after Globaltek Forex makes any such revision,
            you agree to be bound by the revised Terms of
            Use.
